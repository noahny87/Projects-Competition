We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..,5,1
During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue.

Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.,3,1
Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!,5,1
I don't know what you will look for in terms of price performance point; taste; but yigit restaurant writes a big plus for those who come to work in this region.,3,1
Generally good.,4,1
What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase,5,1
Delicious food at rock bottom prices. Friendly staff; Highly recommend,5,1
"Every time I go, I still experience the amazement I experienced years ago as if it were the first time. There is no need to explain. Folk hero is a business.",5,1
The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.,5,1
The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.,5,1
The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place. The friend who took our order said half a half pizza and we preferred half chicken and half steak. Two people were easily satisfied; a lot of patterns.,5,1
"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price.",2,0
It is in the center; easy to reach; close to the parking lot; the prices are partially affordable; the products are delicious but not quite satisfying; the seating places are cramped; the place is a little flat.,4,1
They make delicious pizza with nice ingredients on thin dough. Slice pizza and all pizza options are available. You can try two different flavors as a whole by making two different choices for the whole pizza. We wanted the mushroom and sausage. It was very nice; warm; and it was cooked in its consistency without drying the ingredients.,5,1
It's in a nice place but it's very small and their pizza is not that good to be exaggerated. Pizza dough is nice and thin. They do not offer advice to the customer.,3,1
I strongly recommend. If I come to the taste part; it was very enjoyable to eat with their special sauces. Also the whole pizza was huge.,5,1
It is very tasty; similar to Italian pizzas. Roast beef and mohair 180 TL; other pizzas 150 TL. An adult male eats 6 slices; pizzas are one size and 8 slices.,4,1
Do not come around Marmaris and do not leave without eating pizza at Pizza Fellas. We ate mixed pizza; they can make two types of pizza. So delicious!,5,1
I never thought that the best pizza I've ever eaten would be in Akyaka. Thin pizzas are very tasty and the options are very good. We recommend it to everyone who comes to Akyaka.,5,1
It was as if a very delicious Italian chef had come out of his hands. You can eat with pleasure. The owners are very good people. I recommend.,4,1
The pizza is big enough for 2 people. The dough is very thin. Price is between 120-140 TL.,4,1
The environment; the interest and friendliness of the employees; the taste is incredible. It is so beautiful inside that you do not prefer to sit at the bottom of the sea. Depending on the day; there are also things that are not written on the menu; be sure to check it out. Hours have passed since the meal; we are still talking about the beef brisket.,5,1
Without any taste how they are at the first rank!!!! We ate cafe Inn pizza. It was 70 tl.,1,0
Pizza is delicious.. I can say it is one of the rare tastes. Prices are in the 200-300 range and one pizza is more than enough for two people if you are not very hungry. The scenery is already gorgeous.,5,1
The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.,4,1
Whatever we ate was good. The Italian Restaurant is the first thing that comes to mind; apart from pizza and pasta; ciger yahni was successful; purslane salad; presentations are successful. Taste point in Datca.,5,1
Very enjoyable beautiful place. Pizza salad food taste is great.,5,1
Its breakfast is more satisfying than the places around it.,4,1
Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.,5,1
The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in Dat√ßa is here..,3,1
It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.,5,1
When I went; I waited for almost 20 minutes for the waiters to take care of me. The taste was not bad. The surrounding was beautiful.,2,0
"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive.",3,1
I had the creamy chicken vegetable stew. It tasted excellent. It was quite satisfying. The environment is beautiful and spacious.,5,1
quality service and rich menu. the attitude of the staff is really excellent. A business that deserves 5 stars.,5,1
The sushi was too small so it was not possible to taste the ingredients; the rice was overcooked and lacked flavor; it was missing except for the tail of the shrimp.,2,0
The staff was very engaged. Service and taste were perfect.,4,1
Perfect location next to the sea. Music; light in the evening lounge atmosphere. In short; everything is beautiful.,4,1
"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad.",2,0
Good quality service; nice customer service; they are happy to help with a smile.,5,1
Scrambled eggs with casserole and toast waited 30 minutes. At 12:30pm the main menu was denied and showed only breakfast available. Prices are much higher than other places.,2,0
"Nice view, good staff, clean place and nice atmosphere.",3,1
Nice food and good service; located just near the beach as well.,5,1
It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.,4,1
Kebabs are good; trotters are good; desserts are good. Actually; the decor part of the atmosphere is good. Only a lot of noise comes from the kitchen part. Employees are smiling.,4,1
If you come to Antep; sit down and taste the Beyran soup; served plain and with garlic.,5,1
I asked for garlic; but I had a hard time getting the taste of the meat from the garlic flavor. I'll try again with little or no garlic. Quite satisfying. I like the taste too; you should definitely try it.,4,1
Taste was amazing! Price was not high.,4,1
When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.,2,0
We were very satisfied. I strongly recommend trying it. Delicious appetizers come with the meals.,5,1
The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.,3,1
We ate 1 mumbar and 1 kusleme and paid 310 TL. The meals were very tasty.,4,1
Very cheap and delicious!,5,1
Ayran came when the meal was over; the food was very bitter.,5,1
Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!,5,1
We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.,2,0
We came because it is a very famous place. They had really delicious food.,4,1
Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.,3,1
The taste was very good but the prices were also very high.,5,1
Located in Gaziantep historical bazaar; the place stands out with its beautiful and spacious ambiance. I liked the place very much; we came for dessert after dinner.,5,1
I had the chance to taste many flavors; all of them were very good; I was amazed by Ali Nazik Kebab.,5,1
The restaurant that made our four-day Gaziantep holiday poison! There is already excessive noise; it is impossible to hear the person next to you. The waiters are indifferent; the order takes too long to arrive.,1,0
"They sold us rotten pistachios, it sucks!",1,0
I don't know why we ate here despite the exorbitant prices. A portion of kebab or sis meat product starts from 220 TL as of the end of June 2023. Naturally; you expect a good portion; but a tiny portion in the middle of the plate.,2,0
"A great business that does not compromise on its taste; lahmacun, garlic kebab; yoghurt kebab; the smile of the waiters; everything is in place; thank you very much for the nice service and delicious food.",5,1
The breakfast was very good; I recommend it; the presentations were also eye-catching. We paid 240tl for the table you see in the photo; including 6 teas and 2 Turkish coffees.,5,1
The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.,4,1
Beautiful place. The breakfast is said to be good. I had tea in the evening; it was delicious. It tastes like a samovar. The environment is calm. The music is jazz style; suitable for the calm and soft atmosphere.,5,1
Hookah and ambiance is super!,5,1
They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire.,3,1
Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.,1,0
Great.,4,1
Lovely; affordable seafront spot to while away the afternoon smoking nargile and playing backgammon (tavla). Super hospitable employees and enjoyable ambience.,5,1
A cheap and delicious place. If you are passing by; you should not continue without having a cup of tea.,4,1
Seaside great view!,5,1
Prices are nice,4,1
Bitter; mango; Bodrum tangerine; honey almond; Big Babas; mastic gum; walnut; blackberry and forest fruit definitely recommend..,5,1
The prices are cheap from the center; the ice cream is legendary; don't miss out; it's worth waiting in line; it's the best ice cream shop in Fethiye. Real milk ice cream,5,1
Absolutely perfect come try it..,5,1
Terrible. This is a lie. This is not ice cream! This gum is an ice cream substitute.,1,0
As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.,4,1
The atmosphere of the place was nice; if you want to taste the ice creams; I can say that it is an ordinary ice cream that you can eat anywhere.,3,1
It literally gave me the feeling of chewing sugar. It's not even about ice cream.,2,0
We visited with my friends. The lemon one was great!,4,1
A great taste. I went on recommendation; it was really true. I also recommend it to you.,5,1
Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.,5,1
On the way to the city center of Fethiye; a sweet place caught our attention. The ice cream cone-shaped totem on the road was very original.,4,1
The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.,4,1
A place that makes unorthodox burgers in Samsun. The hamburger bread is big and wide with lots of sesame seeds.,4,1
It's a very nice place; the hamburger is very nice. The staff is very good; there is a children's playground,5,1
The place is nice; the waiters work sulkily. The location; service and presentation are beautiful. And his hamburger might be the most mediocre hamburger I've ever had. There is no meat taste in the meatball.,2,0
Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.,3,1
They have really saturated menus. The prices are very good; and as a place with a very nice interior and exterior decor with sea views; I would definitely recommend it at the same time.,5,1
I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.,1,0
The burger is successful; but the service is very slow; I came to the place 2 times; they bring the order incorrectly.,3,1
The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying.,5,1
The price was not right; I bought a 2-piece menu; the burger and bread did not taste good.,2,0
The prices were generally reasonable; the tastes were also good enough.,4,1
The menus offered by the friendly staff are something else; the flavors we have tasted.,5,1
"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance.",4,1
The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.,3,1
Taste is exactly the same as in classic hamburgers; prices are extra high.,4,1
Every time I come to Fethiye; I stop by and fill my stomach with pleasure.,4,1
In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.,4,1
The ambiance of the place looks a bit old.,3,1
They are very fast and the food tastes good too.,5,1
The potatoes were almost dead and tasteless.,2,0
I didn't like the gloomy; dark atmosphere of the environment; the toilets are dirty; you are disgusted to wash your hands.,2,0
There was a hair in the fries; disgusting.,1,0
In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.,4,1
It is a place where the food is as amazing as the cocktails. The sole fish was very good. employees are very engaged.,5,1
"Slagethi all nero was excellent. Beef ribs were always tender enough. Cheek, on the other hand; has preserved its taste even though its collection is a little small. If deterioration was to come; the services were passed and the environment was much expected.",3,1
As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.,4,1
For people living in Marmaris; it is a beautiful place to visit in summer and winter. I recommend you to try liver because they serve it in a way I have never tried before and because of its amazing taste.,5,1
Wonderful place where you can go with your family and have fun; nice place with live music...,5,1
Prices were slightly higher than peers.,4,1
Pukka is a restaurant by the sea where you will have the most beautiful pictures and videos where you can organize a nice organization in Marmaris.,4,1
Great concept and very tasty food.,5,1
Popular place for Winter and Summer; food and drink menu wide enough and delicious.,5,1
Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.,4,1
The interior design is simple and pleasant; with balconies and upper floors with sea views.,5,1
"I can say that my worst flat white experience. ""Would you like milk?"" they said. I drank more milk than coffee.",1,0
A great starbucks branch located in Bodrum center / bazaar / port. It's great because the layout; the environment; the place and the service are very successful.,5,1
The place is very narrow; I can say it's the worst starbucks I've ever seen.,2,0
It was a pleasant snack; a refreshing drink in hot weather.,5,1
"The view is super, the cleanliness is bad, the location is very good",4,1
The place is so sweet. but it gets too crowded in the evenings.,5,1
Familiar coffee that I taste,3,1
Had to stop by for a take out coffee during the morning hours.,3,1
Employees are very warm. in a very pleasant location.,5,1
The employees are very good and caring. Best Starbucks..,4,1
Here you can find by far the best 4-cheese pizza you can eat in Bodrum. On top of that; you may have reasons to come back again and again with the unusual taste and presentation of the magnolia.,5,1
A place we found by chance during the winter season. First of all; we sat down to drink coffee and the environment was so spacious and calm that I was able to hold a meeting that I had to do over the web without any problems.,5,1
I have never seen a pizza with such a thin pizza dough that the material did not fall apart. Pizza mista is a great choice for mixed lovers.,4,1
It is a very nice place to watch the matches; when it is closed in winter.,4,1
A pleasant place with a beach; delicious food,5,1
It is a place where you can both enter at home and spend time with pleasure and eat and drink. The beach is very beautiful; your sea is clean. The food is also very good.,5,1
It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.,2,0
We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.,5,1
It is a restaurant-bar with an extraordinary ambiance. It has an excellent location on Bodrum Beach. The service is top notch and leaves nothing to be desired.,5,1
Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.,4,1
Beautifully located restaurant on the beach; very nice staff and very good value for money; would gladly come again.,5,1
Nice place with a view. Not bad in terms of food but ordinary.,3,1
A place where you pay for the view. In general; although the breakfast is good; 80tl per person for two people 160tl is a bit high.,4,1
It has a location by the sea; a layout that allows for indoor and outdoor seating. Their waiters are nervous and sometimes indifferent.,3,1
It was very nice that the food was delicious; the place was facing the beauty of Alanya Castle and especially all the staff were interested.,5,1
Good salep was good; the employees were smiling..,4,1
Food was tasteless. The waiters were not smiling at all.,3,1
We wanted mint lemonade; they put mint syrup in the lemonade; when we asked; they said that's what we do; but if you don't like it; we'll change it and they changed it.,2,0
A large spacious place. If you want; you can relax inside and have something to drink.,5,1
Location is nice. We love it as a family. Pizza was delicious.,5,1
Stylish; decent and clean place. I advise.,5,1
In a beautiful location by the sea; sometimes it gets very crowded; the service can be delayed,5,1
I think it came with a change in taste with the price update.,2,0
It's nice; but it's very late. I place an order; it arrives an hour later; I would be happy if it was a little faster.,3,1
A delicious doner.,4,1
the ambiance was nice.,4,1
Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.,2,0
Awesomeee,5,1
"Delicious doner. I went there with my friend, that was she's first. She liked too.",5,1
"Nice place, good price; good quality",5,1
Delicious!,4,1
It was one of the best doner I've ever eaten in my life. Thank you very much.,5,1
There were problems with cleaning. Chefs must wear gloves.,1,0
The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.,4,1
We went for breakfast in the morning; the atmosphere is nice. breakfast items were good and tasty.,5,1
The cafe was cheap enough; I ate with my family.,5,1
We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.,5,1
The indoor atmosphere was nice; but I can't say the same for the outdoor,4,1
We were very satisfied from the staff to the meal.,5,1
Ambiance was good.,4,1
Clean business; I liked it.,5,1
They didn't care about us when we went.,1,0
The restaurant is well located and above all it is nicely decorated and clean.,4,1
Good quality drinks and food.,5,1
Good location; no parking problem. The business is a little small. The products are considered good.. I didn't like the Sakarasƒ± dessert very much. Meat skewer and knife were not bad. Prices are normal..,4,1
Employees are kind. Food is delicious,5,1
The okra soup was hot and scrumptious to the broth. The meat loaf and tandoori kebab were excellent. We ate in the garden with pleasure in a cool weather.,5,1
One of my favorite places in Konya in terms of service; hygiene and taste.,4,1
It is one of the rare places where I can taste the Etli Ekmek I ate in my childhood.,5,1
My wife and I liked the meat loaf very well; as the distance between the knives is very good. The downside was that there weren't enough toilets; we waited in line.,4,1
I had heard that meatloaf was good; but the taste was not that praiseworthy.,2,0
The food is delicious; but the portions are very small and the prices are so high.,2,0
Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.,4,1
Prices are high; even for the yogurt we didn't order; we were charged.,1,0
Service is very slow. The ayran comes in advance; neither foam remains nor we saw here for the first time that buttermilk is paid.,1,0
The atmosphere of the place and the interest of the waiters were good. Food came fast and hot. We ordered spicy tabokki; it wasn't bitter; it tasted very good. We ordered cheese kimbab and it had cheddar in it. I don't recommend it to those who don't like seaweed.,4,1
"Atmosphere of the restourant was amazing, I felt times that I in Korea",4,1
The products were delicious; the service was fast; the employees were smiling and interested. Bulgogi mildly spiced meat was delicious.,5,1
We had very high expectations; but unfortunately we did not like it. Chicken was very sweet. Prices are not too high. You wait in line outside.,2,0
It was really nice; I liked it very much. Moreover; the prices are quite normal. Well done to everyone who worked there.,5,1
Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.,4,1
I don't know much about Korean cuisine; but I have tasted it. Chicken with soy sauce was cooked to a great consistency and served warm.,5,1
I had been to a different Korean restaurant before; the ambiance there really made me feel like I was in Korea. I couldn't feel that feeling here.,2,0
foods are good. but the environment and service is not a full korean experience.,3,1
Super taste; best rose rabokki I've ever eaten in my life. At the same time; we ordered a gimbap with kimchi; and we think it suits them very well.,5,1
A nice place where you can taste examples of Korean cuisine. The closest taste to Turkish cuisine on the menu. Traditional chicken. Prices are very reasonable.,4,1
The flavor that I ate as a child is here; but there were many queues; as in all parts of Istanbul.,3,1
Patso starts from 50tl. It comes with lots of potatoes in the bread wrapped in paper; dipped in ketchup or mayonnaise according to your needs. You have to eat standing up. It does not have a special flavor; but it is satisfying,3,1
There was no place to sit and eat; we ate standing. It tasted good.,4,1
I have never eaten such a delicious patso until now. Recommended guys. And I went again and I will continue to go again.,5,1
I ate the big patso with sausage and cheddar; the potatoes are absolutely incomparable with the frozen flavorless potatoes of many places today. It is a perfect form of sausage bread; potatoes and cheddar blended with sauce; and it is satisfying.,5,1
We ate the classic patso burger. In other words; french fries between fresh sandwich bread; ketchup mayonnaise on top. It tasted very good. No seating; we went to the park right next door and ate there.,4,1
Prices are not real; we thought it was a camera joke.,3,1
"It was very crowded, We wait while we're hungry!",1,0
Crispy on the outside; soft on the inside. It's always hot; it's a little crowded; there's no place to sit.,5,1
I tried the large patso with sausage and cheddar. It was delicious and fresh. You can try.,4,1
Great patso!,5,1
160-year-old Vefa Bozacisi has not lost its flavor. We can find filled bottles in many places; but it's different to come here and drink. It's definitely fresher to drink on the spot.Vefa Bozacƒ±sƒ±,5,1
It was very nice to taste the boza in the historical place. Way better than other bozas.,4,1
A historical place intertwined with history. The business is clean and tidy. The staff is very caring.,5,1
Boza's are beautiful. The ones on sale are also freshly filled and prepared. It looks clean; but I don't know the exact details.,5,1
Same taste for years. Its historical texture is another beautiful place.,3,1
The taste is very good; and you can buy some roasted chickpeas; and it will be very high. Employees should be smiling.,4,1
The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.,3,1
Perfect!,5,1
I don't understand what kind of business it is to sell boza in a foam glass. Offering chickpeas is a tradition next to the spoiler; but in Vefa you have to go and buy it yourself from the shop on the opposite side.,1,0
Vefa Bozacisi must be the most beautiful place that comes to mind when Boza is mentioned. The groceries are quite affordable.,5,1
It is a flavor that can be tried when you go to Istanbul.,4,1
It is not p/p. Doner came cold and that's why it was hard.,3,1
Eating with this view... It was legendary!,5,1
There is a place to eat fish and bread across the beautiful place. If the weather is nice; we go to this doner shop; if not there. You can try.,4,1
They deserve the stars more than enough for their service; hygiene and view; but if we talk about the food; I can say that it was the most delicious in a one-week Istanbul trip without exaggeration.,5,1
Different from the price on the menu Price has been applied doner is dry and hard.,1,0
A taste that hasn't changed for years with its legendary view and taste!,5,1
You can go even for the view... The interest is very beautiful.. Those who want to eat meat (Halal food) should definitely stop by..,5,1
We finished Iskender and Doner Burger with difficulty two weeks ago; we couldn't start the dessert part because there was no appetite for tail fat.,2,0
Great.,4,1
Ambiance was amazing!,5,1
I think they make very good doner kebabs. We did not have any problems with the service. We parted happily as a family. As for the price; I think such a place has a very good tariff for such a view.,5,1
"When we asked for a hamburger, we were told that it was not left; but the hamburger came to the side table; I'm breaking two points from here; other than that it was good.",3,1
"Service, attention is excellent. The masters working in the kitchen love their job. Dining halls and sinks are very stylish; organized and hygienic.",5,1
The presentation was very successful; the employees were very interested and thoughtful and everything was delicious. We thank you.,5,1
Food service was also very fast. I ate a delicious Lokum meat. Then I ate an unbelievably good burger.,5,1
The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.,5,1
Prices are so high..,1,0
I do not recommend the lamb cage at all. But skewered and tenderloin are great. My carrot slice isn't bad. The waiters are interested and polite; but there are difficulties in understanding the order. You would like it cooked well; it comes undercooked.,4,1
We've been here many times and each time we left satisfied; Lokum meat; spaghetti; nusret hamburger; salad with tulum cheese; etc. very good but of course high in price compared to many places.,5,1
It's as if your old meticulousness is gone. The cage arrived cold; the salad came for 1; I said two; I did not drink alcohol; but 6 double raki was written in my account; when I told the waiter; he said are you sure you didn't drink?,2,0
There is a queue at the door; there are wonderful places in Sarƒ±yer. I came with the force of my friends; the music chosen is similar to the music played in Italian pizzeria.,2,0
He's very successful. Even though it was very crowded; the service was incredibly fast.,5,1
By the lake; with a beautiful view; ducks are swimming next to you. 1 pan of squid; 1 portion of sea bass; 1 salad; 2 50 sized tuborgs; 2 tea 80 TL.,4,1
The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.,4,1
DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!,1,0
Right next to the K√∂yceƒüiz lake; the prices are a click above the average; a good business with a panoramic view of the lake.,4,1
Thank you.,5,1
Mexican chicken was hearty; hot and fresh in portion. Service was a little late. An ideal place to dine with a lake view.,4,1
Koycegiz is the most popular restaurant and cafe. You can have a meal with the view of K√∂yceƒüiz lake and sip your cold beer with pleasure.,5,1
A place we stopped by for breakfast on the way. The place has a beautiful view of K√∂yceƒüiz lake. The owner is very sweet and helped us with everything.,3,1
It was rainiy but the ambiance was good enough.,4,1
They bring delicious yoghurt to the dishes; the portions are hearty; with a beautiful view of the lakeside.,4,1
I recommend the handmade hamburger at a good price; reasonable (50TL) and satisfying. Sprinkled village breakfast (125 TL per person) is a weak; ordinary breakfast.,4,1
Tantuni was amazing. We just came here to try it.,5,1
In general; it is delicious; you can ask for both wrap and bread. Although the waiting time is around 10 minutes; the red cabbage and pickled peppers served from the front satisfy you.,4,1
It is a cheap and delicious place for students.,5,1
Tantuni was amazing. Thank you Cici Tantuni!,5,1
The pickles that came after you placed your order were very nice. Tantuni is not bad; you can try it. But I would say it's a little oily.,4,1
Great tantuni; thanks!,5,1
The ambiance of the place was a bit dark.,4,1
I tried tantuni with yoghurt for the first time. The taste was perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. It reminds me of the taste of iskender.,5,1
Prices are like that.,4,1
It was very oily; but good in taste. Prices are a little higher than usual.,4,1
Not bad.,3,1
If you want a different taste in Ka≈ü; they serve it by putting meat; chicken or meatballs cooked for a long time on the bun bread; you can order the drink separately with fried potatoes.,5,1
A fast food restaurant with very friendly staff. It didn't appeal to my taste at all. Undercooked dough and lint meat.,3,1
Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.,4,1
It has a hearty menu that starts with a very sweet encounter; it was quite delicious; the pepper sauce they made is successful.,5,1
There are many options on the menu and the average portion price is 50 TL. One portion is very satisfying; but if you don't like dough; you've come to the wrong address. They put the ingredients of your choice between a soft steamed bread.,5,1
I really liked the handmade basil buttermilk and lemonade. The chicken sandwich is okay; I think the chocolate one has nothing to say; it only had strawberries in it; there could be more fruit like waffles.,4,1
I can say that cleanliness; taste; warm-blooded employees were absolutely perfect.,5,1
We came to Bunbun for a snack at noon. We generally liked what we ate; including the vegan ones. We especially loved the one with beetroot. Meaty ones are nice. I really liked their fries.,5,1
They make hamburgers from bun bread and come with french fries. Quite tasty and satisfying.,4,1
If you come to Ka≈ü and do not eat bunbun here; you are not considered to have come to Ka≈ü. I would definitely recommend you to try it. Especially the ayran is wonderful.,5,1
We ordered meatballs and handmade meatballs that were baked for 6 hours. Meatballs were delicious; meat was delicious.,4,1
Even though it was overcrowded; our orders came very quickly. Except for the k√ºnefe; all the treats were delicious. The k√ºnefe tasted oily. I recommend you to go to a very clean and relevant place.,5,1
You get full like crazy in the range of 150-200 per person. It's beautiful inside. Easy to access.,3,1
Orders that came really shockingly fast and the treats were delicious.,5,1
The treats were excellent; but I did not like the main dish; it was not fully cooked; other than that; the treats and service were very good.,3,1
"I always go to this restourant, the treats are constantly renewed and the kebabs are good. There are sweet treats after the meal. The only problem is that it is usually very full and noisy.",4,1
The treats are constantly being refreshed.. all the waiters are very interested.. The taste was not overly good.,3,1
There was no delay in meals. As soon as the soup was finished; the meal arrived. The meals are quite delicious.,5,1
As soon as you sit down; treats come to your table. Abundant; varied and constantly renewed refreshments. It is a recommendation to everyone who got full marks from us...,5,1
Lots of quality extras and unlimited treats. After the meal; cigarettes are offered as a treat; which is very interesting.,5,1
This is the best aspava restaurant. The treats were perfect.,5,1
Appetizers and service came quickly. The glasses are badly scratched. Especially the fries were fresh and delicious. Raw meatballs and stuffed meatballs were like mud without flavor.,3,1
I recommend profiteroles and meringue; they are their own production. The entrance is suitable for the disabled. It's good that they're paying attention to this.,5,1
The best place to eat local food in Muƒüla. Master Fikret's food is excellent. You should definitely stop by here.,5,1
I went with my friends; their milk desserts were very good.,5,1
The cheddar pastry was very bad compared to the past. It has reached the level of a normal patisserie; it used to be better.,3,1
We went to eat dessert as a family and we were satisfied. It was a bit crowded.,4,1
It's cold and extremely bad; the price of the food is way above its quality; 46 liras for 6 meatballs; 30 minutes or more waiting time. I definitely don't recommend it.,1,0
Very good quality and expensive also always crowded.,4,1
Good.,4,1
Everything you eat is very fresh and delicious. The back of the place is in the concept of a restaurant and the 2nd floor is in the concept of a cafe. We liked it very much.,5,1
I ate awesome pasta; I recommend to you..,5,1
Recommend.,4,1
It can be preferred for breakfast. The salt of the flakes was a little lacking; so it affects the taste; but it was not a problem.,3,1
"Bagel / crispy is tasteless; the outer crust is hard, and the tea is tasteless due to its water. Boiled egg craved but I gave up because it was peeled.",4,1
Prices are very affordable; boyoz is fresh and nice. Finding breakfast items such as olives; cheese and honey in addition to Boyoz also adds to the beauty.,5,1
The most beautiful boyoz is clear here! Those who claim otherwise should reconsider their taste. I have never eaten such good boyoz in my life.,5,1
I like it a lot. Prices are reasonable. Many varieties of boyoz available.,4,1
In terms of taste; minced meat and pastrami were very good. Tahini was medium. Olive was good too.,3,1
The boyoz with mozzarella was legendary; the salt taste coming from the back really makes the boyoz delicious.,5,1
It's a very cute oven. It opens early in the morning. Boyozes are very delicious; I loved the one with mozzarella.,5,1
I ate boyoz for the first time. For me; I guess I wouldn't eat it again. Frankly; it's not a taste that I will look for and miss.,2,0
I ate a variety of boyoz for the first time and I liked it very much. The service is fast and the atmosphere is friendly. If you come to Izmir; do not pass by here.,5,1
I came with recommendation and it really tasted good. It doesn't have a very different taste; so I don't think you will have a problem whether it fits your palate or not.,4,1
It was the best SushiCo restaurant I've experienced. Sushi was perfect and delicious.,5,1
First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.,3,1
Great atmosphere!,5,1
Service was good; transportation was easy. Prices are above average. For those who don't like the taste of raw fish; I recommend roles instead of nigiri.,4,1
The food is fresh; delicious and the atmosphere is quality as always.,5,1
Pretty good sushi; attentive; friendly service..,5,1
Liked.,4,1
The flavors were good in general; the prices were a bit high.,4,1
It didn't suit my taste but my wife loved it. The place was beautiful.,3,1
Started off well with nice duck sushi and prawn gyoza; but was given wrong meat in pad Thai so sent it back. No apologies. Ordered spring rolls; they never came.,1,0
Very clean restaurant... Tasty suchi and noodles.,5,1
We ordered sole fish; fried haddock; fried mussels; and sardines. Our favorite among them was sole fish. The only thing that bothered me was that the men's and women's toilets were a common and single toilet.,4,1
The taste really lives up to expectations. It is a business that maintains frying fish; which is essentially a fast food; in accordance with its craft. I liked.,4,1
Delicious!,5,1
Very cheap against portions.,5,1
Our back hurt while eating; the place was clean.,2,0
Fish and bread are delicious but the place has gone back every year. Cleanliness and hygiene are almost non-existent; employees are weary and reluctant.,3,1
I think they cook very fast and delicious fish; and they have very sweet employees; I definitely recommend them. I also strongly recommend the pickle juice and sole fish.,5,1
Prices are a little bit high.,3,1
We ate our meal on the top floor; the location of the place was beautiful. The flavors and portions were good. I suggest you to eat fish bread.,5,1
I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily.,4,1
Portions are huge.. sardines are delicious; fish is very oily; so you have to eat bread. Therefore; the best choice is between bread.,4,1
There are only Kumru and Kumpir options; the Kumru is not bad; it needs a little more oil; I can't say it's very tasty. The place is beautiful in terms of location; but there is a crowd; so the staff cannot keep up.,2,0
The material of the kumru is medium quality; the portion is small. We were 3 persons. All three of us had burnt bread.,3,1
Excellent. I recommend.,5,1
I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come!!,5,1
"Crowded but no problem, flavor is okay.",4,1
"Kumpir is delicious. Super Kumru is really good. Compared to other places, we can say that the prices are reasonable and the service quality is high. quality materials used.",5,1
I'm really surprised; it's a huge business; but the staff is so indifferent and bored.,2,0
"Beautiful place; in a perfect location; clean and equipped with quality; these definitely deserve a star; but as someone who loves dove and has experienced it in every corner of Izmir (Al√ßatƒ±; Bostanlƒ±; ƒ∞nciraltƒ±; √áe≈üme; etc.), this ""dove"" is not the only thing that can be said.",4,1
Food came a little late but that was okay. Prices were as you can see in the photo. It wasn't a bad experience.,3,1
I can recommend it to those who want to eat a delicious dove in a beautiful place. Kumru's price is 45‚Ç∫.,4,1
Definitely. Texts the dove's book. The Kumpir they ordered was also excellent.,5,1
Bread was a bit stale and no problem except taking the order late and waiting. Meatballs are delicious as always.,4,1
The order came fast. I loved the doner and chicken. It was well cooked. But orders came late.,4,1
The place was really dirty and the orders came late.,3,1
Great service.,4,1
The fact that all the employees were women made me very happy; the tastes were good.,5,1
Their service was a little slow; the flavors were on point. I had breakfast; there was unlimited tea; it was a different situation that they brought the tea in a water glass.,3,1
Great service; attention and relevance It was nice. Everything was perfect.,5,1
Its meatballs are beautiful. So is soup and salad too.,5,1
The meat had a fabricated taste.,4,1
Kofteci Yusuf tastes the same everywhere. employees are constantly running towards somewhere; it is very difficult to catch and order.,5,1
We told the staff a very modest breakfast plate; there is unlimited tea; and the breakfast was really good. There was everything up to 4 kinds of cheese and it only cost 54 liras.,5,1
Nice atmosphere; pleasant place. The employees are young; smiling and fast. The breakfast is very nice. Souffles are A-MA-ZING!,5,1
They do sushi every thursday and I missed so it was a little sad to miss it. Other than that; the food was good.,5,1
Definitely the best souffl√© I've had in a long time. I am satisfied; I recommend.,5,1
Asian salmon pastas and salad varieties are very successful. They have not neglected to share the secret of their taste.,4,1
Not bad.,3,1
Souffle heaven has a wonderful variety of flavors; I highly recommend it.,5,1
The waiters were understanding; but the food came cold and late.,3,1
I tried Antep taco; I liked.,4,1
The prices are the same as the market; but the staff and service quality are better than others; their special tastes are definitely recommended.,5,1
Not very special Gaziantep dishes; but you can find a comfortable and serene atmosphere in Antep. One of the places that can be stylish for the evening.,3,1
Taco; on the other hand; was no different than a vegetable wrap wrapped in lavash. It was a decent experience.,1,0
The staff is very fast; the waffles are great; I definitely recommend it.,5,1
The waffle was very successful; especially the dough was very delicious. The ice cream they use with such a nice waffle is of very poor quality. The only negative thing is that the employees are constantly checking to see if the food is finished.,4,1
Although they are actually a place that makes waffles; their burgers are delicious and they have a lot of options.,4,1
It had very good service. It was also nice to have a lot of choices in waffles.,5,1
You can add the product you want to the waffle or hamburger with your own choice. You're kind of the chief.,3,1
Waffles were delicious and their tea was fresh. It wasn't insane for the price. I'm thinking of coming again.,5,1
Everything was very good; the waffles were very tasty; the employees were very concerned and smiling. It is recommended.,5,1
It's a great place with everything; it's a very good place whether it's about food or interest; it's a very nice place for waffles.,4,1
I can say that it is the only cafe in Samsun where you can eat waffle dessert properly. You can go without thinking.,5,1
"Good waffles, we liked it.",5,1
I ate better waffle's in past.,2,0
It was the most delicious adana kebab I ate in Alanya. The prices were also normal. The only thing missing was the salad.,4,1
Renovated is pretty good. There is nothing to say about the food and the soups. Especially the lahmacun was perfect.,5,1
don't accidentally break a glass or plate; they add 20 lira to your account unannounced.,1,0
Location of the restourant was good; easy to access.,4,1
Everything is very good; thank you for your efforts; the meats and dishes in the newly added a la carte menus are legendary; I definitely recommend it.,5,1
smiling employees..,5,1
Good place to eat. However; the staff work poorly: They can easily forget to bring some dishes or add seasonings; even though they previously admitted to the contrary.,3,1
Not the best; but not bad.,3,1
Quite unpolite service; but the meal was good. The salad with the vinegar was extremely good.,3,1
Everything was great; definitely coming back when I'm in Alanya again.,5,1
We came here with my family. Staff was very friendly; responsive and professional. Our order was delivered very quickly. The restaurant serve Turkish cuisine. One of the best in Alanya. Recommended.,5,1
I drank Beyran soup; the taste of the soup was not bad. The lahmacun was good.,4,1
Beyran is really delicious; the service is fast. Friendly and warm waiters.,4,1
We came to drink beyran soup for breakfast. We really liked the taste. The accompanying breads were delicious.,5,1
I had eaten Beyran in a few places; but I didn't like it very much. I drank here and liked it. I can drink it every day.,4,1
We went for Beyran but it didn't in menu today. We had to order lahmacun and kebab. The lahmacun is awful; the adana kebab and lamb shish kebab are delicious.,3,1
I ate katmer here for the first time and I couldn't forget its taste and smell. It may be the most beautiful dessert in the world!!,5,1
We ate Beyran. We preferred less spicy; the price is 60 TL. The place is clean; the service is fast.,5,1
Lahmacun was terrible.,1,0
We tried Lahmacun and Beyran. They were beautiful; thank you.,4,1
I'm ending my vacation by leaving my favorite food here..,5,1
We had the opportunity to taste beyran for the first time in our lives and we had heard of the reputation of Metanet's beyran. At first; we had a bit of a prejudice; to be honest; about the intense aroma of meat or fat; but it's not like that at all. Beyrani is so delicious and balanced that we can eat it at any time of the day; morning; noon and evening.,5,1
A very nice place; five stars as the location. If it is the flavor you are looking for; you may not find the exact flavor that you want.,3,1
Everything is fine; but I have to deduct 1 point because of the prices. There is no problem in taste; presentation and cleanliness.,4,1
They used to taste better; the chef must have changed.,3,1
Great services.,5,1
In terms of price performance; I think it is quite reasonable. Employees were also very kind; thank you. I was very satisfied with the spicy-sweet sauce chicken I ate. Only the fries on the side were too simple in my opinion.,4,1
Breakfast in the morning is usually very crowded on weekends. Service may be delayed. Meals wasn't bad.,2,0
Compared to other places; it was more airy and calm by the sea. Thanks.,3,1
Great ambiance; delicious dishes..,5,1
Due to the crowd; my order came late; there is no problem other than that.,4,1
The food is delicious; the view is beautiful.,5,1
I went on the recommendation of my friend. Everything at breakfast was delicious. Only the butter had a peculiar smell.,5,1
The strawberry cake was great; there was fresh dough. And we only paid for what we ate; drank; portioning; etc. no extra fees were asked. It's a wonderful place,5,1
When there are so many employees; orders are forgotten; tables are not looked at. The food is really delicious.,2,0
I definitely come here every time I come; I like both breakfast and evening meals; but prices have increased a lot from last year to this year.,4,1
The worst service I have seen; no one knows what they are doing ,1,0
If you want a delicious and local breakfast on the beach; you should definitely try it.Kuymak is even closed to discussion.,5,1
there are 10 waiters standing; the tables are empty; but the service is very slow. What we ate was delicious.,3,1
My first stop for breakfast in Atakum is a place with quality service and friendly face.,5,1
It's nice to have a children's playground. There are a lot of staff working. Good as place and location.,4,1
The tastes; the approach of the stuff to you and the quality of service are very good; of course; especially if you can find a place on the weekend.,3,1
Teas we could only drink 1 tea for a cold breakfast; the staff is being artistic to the customer; fighting and walking on top of him; there is an uncomfortable environment.,1,0
This place is beautifully decorated; has excellent staff; successful flavors; plenty of variety.,5,1
The service is absolutely amazing; the working friends are very kind; there is no need to explain the taste; it is a restaurant that should definitely be visited.,4,1
Portions were very filling and good. We had a nice Sunday breakfast.,5,1
The view is nice; the indoor seating area is quite large.,4,1
It is a place to eat good pastries in Sariyer. I recommend you to try the mince raisin. Tea 5 TL 1 portion of Meat Pie with Raisins 30 TL,5,1
Pastries varieties and pogaca are delicious. There are also breakfast options available. The staff is caring and helpful. Service is fast. I think the prices are reasonable.,4,1
Good with potatoes; good with cheese; medium with spinach; medium with minced meat. Plain pastry was good; pastry was good. I did not like the tea.,4,1
Great.,5,1
The prices were too high for a place that sells pastries or pastries.,3,1
I'm a regular at currants and pastries with minced meat. It is both delicious and definitely does not disturb the stomach after eating.,4,1
Service sucks. Customer care is below zero. The view is very good but the place is extremely neglected.,3,1
It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something,5,1
It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.,4,1
The most delicious rice I have ever eaten. The ambiance of the environment is terrific; its desserts were amazing too.,5,1
I ate baruthane kebab with rice; it was very good; a little expensive.,5,1
The place is beautiful and clean. The employees were very kind and concerned. I ate rice and also had saut√©ed chicken. The flavor was good except the chicken saut√© was greasy.,4,1
Prices was high.,3,1
It was nice experience; you have to try it.,5,1
250 TL account was received for 1 portion of rice + kuru fasulye + ayran + Cola. Service and waiters are very bad.,2,0
It's not something to be exaggerated; and people come from out of town just for their rice. The waiters were kind; the environment was clean.,4,1
The flavor is excellent. Roasting meat was like cotton. Price is a little above normal. Location of the restourant was really good.,5,1
There was only 3-4 chickpeas in my rice; it was a bit unsalted. Treats were good. It had a classic rice flavor.,3,1
The menu is very nice; the food is legendary; also the waiters were very polite.,5,1
I had high expectations but the kebabs were unsuccessful. Hummus was good. They use quality olive oil.,3,1
There was a hair strand in my food! There is no problem in service or interest other than this issue; they give the right to the fee they receive.,1,0
"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad.",3,1
Nice place but the order came very late; the prices are not so high. It can be tried.,3,1
"very clean table arrangement is good; waiters are very interested; they look immediately; the order comes without a long wait, the food is really delicious as it is said; it is excellent; I recommend it.",5,1
We came with a guest from abroad; everything was perfect. Taste; cleanliness; service..,5,1
It is a luxurious place where you can try the delicious tastes of both Turkish and Arabic cuisine.,5,1
Please review the ticket slip. A business that wants money for the bread on the table; 20 TL for the service fee; 20 TL for the valet.,1,0
Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!,1,0
Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!,1,0
Hatay gastronomy house is an excellent place; you should definitely go... Quality and affordable...,5,1
Ambient food; nice open area; heated pet friendly place; renovated garden is very nice.,5,1
The venue is beautiful. Food/desserts taste good. I loved the Popcorn Shrimp from the hot appetizers. I loved Pose Armut. Overall good price/performance.,5,1
We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.,4,1
The place is very beautiful; the food is so delicious; you can go with your pet to one of the rare restaurants that cook the meat to the exact consistency you want. The toilets are not separate for men's and women's toilets so there was a bit of a cleaning problem.,5,1
The service is slow; I think there is a lack of staff and unhappiness; it has not to expensive and it was seedy experience.,2,0
Although it was crowded; the ambiance and food of the place was nice. Thank you.,4,1
Great place.. Contrary to the comments; the employees were interested.. The hot dog was impressive.. The hamburger was not bad.,4,1
Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently don‚Äôt take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.,5,1
The service provided was very nice; I was happy.,5,1
Smoked salmon salad was average. Colored eggs do not contribute to the taste. Salmon was too salty; fried potatoes were bland.,3,1
Eggs Benedict with pork bacon was nice.,5,1
Excellent taste; and the shabbyness of the place was also nice.,4,1
A full student meal. The price is cheap and the taste is high.,4,1
It's a place with very affordable and delicious pasta. Actually; there is not much variety of pasta. Classic pasta is served with cheddar cheese and sauce. I think the taste and price of the pasta is very good.,5,1
They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.,1,0
I think it was pretty cool. The price of a portion of pasta was 22 TL. I highly recommend you go.,5,1
classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...,4,1
The taste is unbelievably good and satisfying enough; it is also very affordable; but you have a hard time finding an incredibly crowded place.,4,1
Not to mention pasta; their sauces are so successful that you can destroy the whole plate without noticing. Also; the dumplings are nice.,5,1
Tasty meals.,4,1
It was the most delicious pasta I have ever eaten; thank you.,5,1
Service was fast. I ate ravioli; it was good.,4,1
Surprised location; but nice clean venue. The employees are friendly; I don't want to comment on the prices; they were too high..,3,1
In general; I was satisfied; since the hamburger is a little small; it will be more satisfying if the one with a higher grammage is chosen.,4,1
Burgers are great hot dogs do. It is very interesting that french fries are 114 TL.,4,1
Hamburger is really delicious. The fries are normal.,5,1
The best hamburger restaurant in Istanbul. Cooking and sauce is very good.,5,1
Burgers are super. I've eaten hamburgers in many places; but I've never come across anything like this. Fantastic meal with friendly service in a small but cozy place. I strongly recommend.,5,1
The delicious combination of truffle sauce and burger was legendary.,5,1
It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The only downside is that the portion is a little small. Apart from that; it is definitely a place to experience.,5,1
Well prepared hamburger; special taste. But a little bit expensive.here/,5,1
It is delicious in everything with its sauce and bread.,5,1
The taste is good; but it's not worth paying 90 TL for a wet hamburger-sized burger and not even getting fries...,2,0
They make the pizza in a wood fired stone oven. It's different than any pizza you've experienced before. They use cheddar cheese as cheese. We preferred the 2 and 3 special pizzas.,5,1
I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.,5,1
You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.,5,1
Staff were quick but surly. the service was actually fast; i can't afford it. We ordered chicken and mushroom pizza; its taste was normal; the dough was very thin and it wasn't burnt; which was the only good thing. Coming to the wage issue; there were prices that did not match the prices of luxury restaurants.,2,0
I think it's a nice place. Pizza was also nice; but a little expensive. I liked their sauce.,4,1
First of all; the atmosphere is nice; but there should be a solution for flies in the open air; such as fans that blow water. As for the pizza; although the view is beautiful; neither my wife and I did not like the pizza; unfortunately; the sauces that came only to pour on the pizza were good.,1,0
You should definitely go once and eat pizza. But I don't know if it happened to us; but the faces of the employees were never smiling and they were not caring.,3,1
We did pizza experience after a long road. As a place; it is very nice; pizzas are delicious; but we can say that the prices are a bit expensive.,3,1
Amazing pizzas omg!,5,1
The place is spacious; clean. Pizza dough is thin. You had the chance to try 6 types of pizza; I can say that the best is the model with spinach and smoked turkey.,5,1
"The dough is very crispy and the most successful part is definitely the dough. And the dough was waiting overnight. Also, there is a 2-3 hour queue; so crowded.",5,1
The flavors are number 10. A little expensive; it may be too much for people with a medium budget.,4,1
I ate k√º≈üleme; simit kebab; mixed cubes. The frosting was juicy and pretty good.,5,1
Meats are tasty without fat; but not very suitable for me. Since I like the meat cooked more; I couldn't enjoy it much anyway; I couldn't finish what I ordered. Although the portions are small; the prices are quite expensive.,4,1
I think the place is overrated. We said mixed in the middle; it was a disgusting image. Simit kebab was good. But the prices were too high.,3,1
Delicious but not overdone.,4,1
Expensive.,3,1
Deserts was amazing; especially baklava! Liked it.,5,1
Its k√º≈üleme was great. It was very well cooked and juicy. However; the portion was small and they warn about this before ordering. Still; its meat is so delicious that it is worth eating. Prices are a little expensive.,5,1
4 people mixed menu with their own salad; 750 TL. For those who say price is not a problem. Meat tastes excellent. There is a parking lot.,4,1
We ate k√º≈üleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.,4,1
We came from out of the town to try their meat. We waited in line for a while; but that's okay. It was an amazing experience. I recommend it to everyone.,5,1
It was too oily and the place had problems with cleanliness.,2,0
It was too spicy on my first try; but after a few bites I got used to it. The taste is really good; I like it.,4,1
it tasted so good that I even ordered and ate the second one!,5,1
The taste is good but not satisfying.,4,1
Deliciousss!,4,1
We came to Abidin Tantuni with my friends from out of town. The pickles and of course the tantuni were very nice.,5,1
Tantuni is delicious; service is fast; service is quality. Price of one portion is 85TL,5,1
Great job; thank you!,5,1
we had a delicious tantuni experience. I was amazed by the taste of ayran; pickles and tantuni trio.,5,1
One of the Most Beautiful Meat Tantuni Places. Meat tantuni is very tasty. It's a roadside place. It's a regular restaurant.,4,1
The smell is awesome; the taste is normal; the speed is very good. We are full; thank you very much. Ayran was also nice.,4,1
We wanted to try this place as it is famous. We paid more than 800 liras for 2 people; 1.5 portions of Iskender and a drink.,3,1
Iskender kebab is not a meal worth that much money when I look at the price of 195 TL for 1 portion; rather than its taste.,4,1
Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.,3,1
The first time I ate; it's really worth the price. Taste and hygiene are the most important for me. Toilets were clean.,5,1
My order came cold.,4,1
There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.,5,1
It is very delicious; even the yogurt. However; a very very expensive portion of Iskender should not be 225 liras‚Ä¶,3,1
Iskender kebab is a nice; clean and well-served place in Bursa.,5,1
The interior is very well designed. It has a historical texture. Employees were engaged. Frankly; the taste of iskender was not overly good; it was normal.,4,1
It was delicious as I heard.,5,1
Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.,3,1
The staff is very polite and very concerned. Thank you for the delicious food.,5,1
We ate oil ravioli and special ravioli. The ravioli was weak compared to the price. Employees are smiling.,4,1
We wanted to try it for yaglama; it was disappointing for me; it had little ground meat; it didn't taste good; the appetizers were bad.,2,0
Not perfect but good.,4,1
We ate special ravioli; classic ravioli; yaglama; they were not friendly; their yaglama was like minced meat pasta; not greasing.,2,0
A very pleasant and quiet restaurant. Most importantly; the food is great. Everything I tasted was delicious.,5,1
Recommend.,5,1
The ravioli tasted good and was satisfying as a portion; the portion was very small compared to the price of the yaglama.,2,0
The restaurant is very nice and elegant. We were greeted very kindly; the flavors were good.,5,1
Legendary flavors; I was amazed!,5,1
I tried Kayseri's traditional ravioli and special ravioli. The special was just right for my taste. I like. We also tried yaglama but it wasn't as good as I imagined. It was also cold.,3,1
After waiting for about 20 minutes; we were able to eat Classic Ayvalƒ±k Toast. It was delicious and crunchy.,5,1
Small busy place. We didn't wait long; service was fast. The toast was delicious but the portion was small and expensive.,4,1
First of all; they don't accept credit cards. The place is small; you can wait in line to sit. It's worth the taste.,4,1
I loved it; with one word it was legendary. In other words; it is the best toast you can eat outside. The price is 35 TL for full Ayvalik toast; Ayran Lemonade is 15 TL.,5,1
Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to Ayvalƒ±k.,4,1
Liked.,4,1
We paid 150 TL for 2 toast and 2 ayran. The only address of Ayvalƒ±k Toast. There are many queues; but the queue moves very quickly. Worth the wait.,5,1
Ambiance could be better.,4,1
The place had problems with cleanliness. Prices were a little expensive.,3,1
When you go to Ayvalƒ±k; I definitely recommend you to go here to eat toast. Perfect taste.,5,1
Crispy and delicious toast.,4,1
Excellent Roman pizza. Fast; pleasant and courteous service.,5,1
What an awesome place. The fried starters were lush; as were the rice balls. However; the pizza was amazing; the best I have tasted (in Rome).,5,1
It was quite crowded so we waited in line for a long time. The flavor was good.,4,1
Authentic Italian restaurant; best pizza I ever ate in my life. You know it‚Äôs going to be good when Italians go there. Prices are really cheap as well; it was only 8‚Ç¨ for my pizza.,5,1
I strongly recommend. The best of the best. Very thin and soft. Nice service and reasonable price.,5,1
The pizzeria in the heart of Testaccio is open from 19:00 without reservation... fills up immediately. Excellent typical Roman pizza.,4,1
Great thin crust pizza. Its super busy so be prepared for a decent wait. The suppli and fiore di zucca aren't the best; but the pizzas are top notch.,4,1
It was much better on our last visit (6 years ago). This time we were not satisfied with the service or the quality of the pizza.,3,1
"Not touristic, that's why super. The place is real; truly local; authentic. Atmosphere here is really special. Waiters are cool guys; not trying to be super polite. Love it!",5,1
Awesome locals spot for pizza and typical Roman fare.,5,1
Best pizza around. GOAT status. Have to try that Diavola pizza. Absolutely no cap!,5,1
The food is quite delicious. The prices are higher than the average in Samsun; but suitable for a decent place. The waiters were interested; the appetizers were delicious.,4,1
Diyarbakƒ±r Ocakbasi is one of the most established places of Samsun; but I couldn't understand this branch. The taste of the food is very good; there is no problem about it; but the service is very heavy; the number of staff is insufficient.,4,1
The view is beautiful; the food is good. It's about the waiters. If you are going alone in the evening; a reservation seems to be a must. Too crowded.,5,1
It was a great place; the most beautiful meatloaf I've ever eaten in my life.  The cheddar lahmacun and stuffed ribs were perfect; and the meat had no smell. The service is nice; they respect.,5,1
When we last arrived; many of the products on the menu were not available. It is also interesting that there are no liver skewers in the place called Ocakbasi.,3,1
2 appetizers 1 salad the smell of blood and the taste of meat were disgusting chicken and lamb were fine.,1,0
I gave unnecessary money. It had no taste; no service. It was very expensive.,1,0
A restaurant that has lost its previous refinement. Lahmacun as seen in the photo. The service is slow. I recommend a little more wannabe and attention.,2,0
The food was great; the service was fast and the staff was friendly. Stuffed ribs were very fresh and delicious.,5,1
We tried Lahmacun and Beyti. They both taste great.,4,1
Their meat was incredibly bad. Chicken canada had another taste.  The service is nice; but I would say the flavor is 0. In a cooker; this tastelessness is surprising; obviously.,2,0
It's nice that it's open every time in a day. Turkish coffee + tea + 2 pastries =52TL. Service is average... Turkish coffee is not tasty.,4,1
Delicious tastes; clean place.,4,1
We have a full breakfast and pay 20 TL. Isn't it perfect?,5,1
We had a pleasant breakfast in a bright environment.,5,1
There's a mess inside; the business really needs to improve on the organization.,2,0
A bakery and Patisserie that offers quality; delicious and plenty of options.,5,1
Great cafe. Excellent staff. Brilliant cakes and pastries.,5,1
Thanks for great breakfast experience!,5,1
It seems like the products were better last year.. There is always a queue.,4,1
The donut had no filling in it so it was like sweet bread.,2,0
Loved.,5,1
Prices were cheap. But the queue was too long. I liked the flavors as a korean.,4,1
A delicious udon that you can enjoy even in the middle of summer! It was very hot; cramped and crowded with people and I had two bowls of udon and a side dish with two bottles of booze.,4,1
The set composition was good! Chicken egg rice and karaage were delicious. Many Koreans come here for udon. Waiters are friendly and service is fast!,3,1
Lovely and delicious..,4,1
5-10 min walk from the Louvre (depending on which side you come from). I ate really delicious things. I would definitely recommend.,4,1
The best udon restaurant in the capital! Few tables however; making a lot of waiting at peak times.,5,1
The queue was not that long fortunately! The staffs were all very kind and welcoming. The food was amazing! The udon was the hero; it was very flavorful & juicy!,5,1
There were few tables and chairs inside.,4,1
Best udon in Paris. Well Korean celebrities visits it too. Just a little bit crowded.,4,1
"As an udon restaurant close to the Louvre; it tastes just as good. There's quite a line at lunch, but your turn comes quickly.",5,1
The tempura here is amazing.,5,1
Fast food restourant with a nice view. Staff are also friendly; mostly frequented by tourists.,4,1
Very very bad food and very bad service 0/10.,1,0
A very small hamburger. I can say that there are places where you can eat bigger and delicious hamburger menus for cheaper. The place is very busy and small. Finding a place to sit is a miracle.,3,1
Classic KFC.,4,1
I love fried chicken; I love KFC.,5,1
The menu I ordered was served hot; I ate it with my mouth and it was really perfect. But the place is very small and full to the brim. There is no place to sit.,3,1
It was delicious!,5,1
The chickens are very nice and tasty; I will not say the same for the hamburger.,4,1
Not friendly; zero customer service. Pretty disappointing. Limited ketchup sauce only two per customer..,1,0
They applied extra price because we were tourists; they tried to defraud us officially.,1,0
"The place is very nice; I think, the food was fresh and good; one of my favorite places.",5,1
I ate a lot of croissants; but this was the best quality beautiful croissant I've ever eaten in my life. Crispy on the outside; with lots of butter on the inside; the smell was amazing.,4,1
The place was crowded when we first went. We preferred chocolate croissants. It was fresh and beautiful.,4,1
Three of us went and had Avocado & Poached Eggs; Sausage Scrambled Eggs; Mushroom Scrambled Egg Croissant. I didn't like the avocado croissant because I don't like avocados.,4,1
It's a very enjoyable place. The croissants are amazing! The butter feels very good in mouth; it is crunchy. Salty and sweet; they're all great.,5,1
I recommend..,5,1
Wonderful. The amount of butter used in the croissant was so good that it never lost its taste and crunch. The coffee was fresh and of good quality.,5,1
Cheesecakes are a price / performance product; if they have it; you have to try it immediately. The teas were also very good.,5,1
It was too busy for a Monday. We waited 45 minutes.,3,1
The waiters were indifferent; I was not satisfied.,4,1
The croissants were delicious but tasted a bit bitter due to overcooking. The croissant with adjika was excellent. But we waited a long time,4,1
You wait in line for 20-50 minutes when you leave. Eating the poached egg croissant left a strange feeling in the mouth. Egg with mushrooms was unsalted.,3,1
Each mussel costs 7 liras. The place is big can sit inside and outside. There is a Bosphorus view in the place.,4,1
The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.,5,1
"In a word, super. No need for expensive places. Very tasty; very clean. You can sit at the tables overlooking the Bosphorus and have a pleasant and reasonably priced meal. The staff is very caring.",5,1
Expensive.,3,1
Not too good; not too bad either.,4,1
10 mussels + half a kokorec is 240TL. Also; the place smells like toilet.,1,0
I had the chance to try classic mussels and mussels with sauce. Both were beautiful. Kokorec was also good.,5,1
Prices are a little bit high but tastes are nice.,4,1
In a word; it is magnificent; this is the heart of mussels in Istanbul. Atom kokore√ß must be tasted. The mussels with sauce are another good one..,5,1
Taste has deteriorated compared to the past. I guess it's because he's famous. I do not recommend; you can eat betters in other restourants.,1,0
Magnificent view and legendary taste; and kokorec is also very good; I recommend it to everyone.,5,1
"If you go to Trabzon, it is a place you should definitely visit. I knew it was a historical rice cooker; and it tasted great.",5,1
Rice and roast are delicious! The inside can be visited like a museum; the employees are friendly. It's a bit pricey though; bring cash with you.,4,1
The rice was very oily but the roast was delicious. We paid 450‚Ç∫ for 3 people. Prices are a little high.,3,1
Dishes were really expensive.,4,1
It's just perfect; there is nothing to say.,5,1
A very authentic place; its roasted meat and bean on the rice is legendary‚Ä¶ 1 portion is enough.. The taste of the compote they serve is indispensable‚Ä¶,5,1
2 roasted meat on rice + a ayran and a compote; a total of :220 It was nice that it was better roasted than rice.,4,1
I tried it after the positive reviews. Its rice and compote are nice. However; there are places in the Black Sea where I ate better roast beef. It's not a place I can say you should try. Prices are reasonable. The place is nice; the service was good.,4,1
I have never eaten such delicious roasted rice anywhere. Service presentation and environment was very very nice.,5,1
My order arrived late and cold. Prices were high.,3,1
An incredibly beautiful atmosphere with its historical texture and story. We preferred Roasted Meat on the Rice; it was delicious. Portions are very filling.,5,1
This is a place we always go for peri peri burger and crispy ravioli. Thanks for the treats.,5,1
We ordered the Cream Croissant. The chocolate was bitter and too liquid; I think it would be better if Nutella was applied. It was not a dessert worth the price. (145‚Ç∫). They also forgot the tea I ordered.,2,0
It is much better decorated and the quality has been improved considerably. When you enter; a very pleasant cafe atmosphere and ambiance welcomes you. I recommend sitting close to the wood stove. We ordered breakfast and were satisfied. Toilets were very; very dirty.,3,1
I drank Turkish coffee; it was good.,4,1
The products were delicious; the atmosphere was nice. Prices are reasonable; service needs improvement.,4,1
Great viewed restourant.,5,1
I really liked the atmosphere. The breakfast was very good and worth the price. It is not very expensive; but it is not very affordable either; I think there are ideal prices. Desserts were also excellent.,5,1
They are not good in hygiene; portions are big; taste is good; prices are above average.. View is good.,4,1
Slow service; average taste.,3,1
In short; the plates brought to you are no different from the ones on the menu. Pizza is definitely in the top three I've ever eaten.,5,1
It's a nice cafe. A little curly haired busboy there was very kind to us. The service was nice.,4,1
We came across the Pavlova dish; it was delicious. Their fruit pasta wasn't bad either; but the kids really liked it. The staff is very caring and helpful.,4,1
Izmir bomb was nice. The ice cream tasted like milk (not goat's milk) that I was not used to; but it didn't bother me.,4,1
I am attaching the photos I could take about the menu and its prices. Overall it wasn't bad.,4,1
Although it is a classic; its products are ordinary. Prices are expensive for the quality.,2,0
Lemonade and desserts were terrific.,5,1
Everything we ordered was excellent especially the Pavlova cake.,5,1
Great ambiance.,4,1
I tried Pavlova but it was not what I expected. But it could also be about my choice.,4,1
We tried Tripple Berry Cheesecake and Pistachio Ice Cream; Strawberry Ice Cream. It was a complete disappointment for us. Especially the pistachio ice cream was highly praised; we couldn't understand why he was bragging.,2,0
Menu was like that. Average business.,5,1
Prices too high Turkish coffee 42.5TL Salty cookies weak.,5,1
Spacious; clean and comfortable place. Employees concerned. We didn't wait long for the order. It was one of the best lahmacun I've ever eaten. Prices are affordable.,5,1
It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled.,3,1
The food is very delicious. I congratulate the value and sincerity of the employees in their work.,5,1
The space is comfortable and spacious. The service is fast; the staff is concerned. There are many types of kebab. We ordered shish shish and Adana; the taste is satisfactory. Prices were like market average.,4,1
Taste; hygiene; speed;service were all very good. I went for a late dinner; everything was very good.,5,1
We came from out of town. Kebab and skewers were great; and the strained yogurt appetizer was delicious; we will definitely come to you next visit.,5,1
The staff is very interested and fast; the environment is very nice; the food and appetizers are very tasty.,5,1
I liked the kebab and salad; but I can't say the same for their appetizers. It was less in variety; unfortunately; it was unpleasant for those who came. The ambiance was great.,4,1
It's delicious and the prices are reasonable. The appetizers are very filling and satisfying.,5,1
We were satisfied with the food; but the toilets are very dirty; I am deducting points from this issue.,3,1
Three Portions of Adana Kebab on one skewer and 3 drinks for 106 TL. My expectation was higher in terms of taste; but I cannot say that I could fully find this expectation. But the side dishes were not bad.,4,1
Highly recommend for a different and delicious experience. Being on the beach is very good as a place. Toilets are clean. No bad odor or irritating.,5,1
Everything really appeals to both the eyes and the stomach. They have an incredibly beautiful and varied menu. Prices are reasonable according to the taste; quality and satiety of the menu.,5,1
Every meal is a source of happiness at Magro. This time we tried chicken with almond sauce and Mac and cheese bolognese; it was delicious. Portions are very filling and very reasonable for the price.,5,1
Magro is a really nice place in terms of design. I ate chicken broth soup; tomato soup; magro burger and grilled sea bass. Presentation; portion and taste are good. However; it is very expensive.Service sucks.,2,0
Unique in Alsancak Kordon.. Good food; especially chicken wrap is awesome.,4,1
It is a classical home breakfast; so it is expensive for home breakfast.,3,1
Bad breakfast experince for me.,1,0
Everything I ate that in a super menu; was very good. I recommend this place to everyone.,5,1
Great service; great food; everything is great!,5,1
Nice and beautiful place. The breakfast spread was hearty and good. Prices are normal.,5,1
Margarita pizza is pretty good. The atmosphere is also nice. Toilets are very clean.,4,1
We came here for the first time; we just tried the doner; it was good; the treats were not bad; the staff was very interested.,5,1
Lahmacun tasted good and was filling. Some of the ingredients used in the salad started to deteriorate.,3,1
They've updated the prices and it's as if they have reduced the portions. It is irritating that the edges of the plates are broken.,3,1
Liked.,5,1
I didn't like Iskender; the meat was not of good quality.,3,1
Even though it's not as good as it used to be; it's still my choice. I would be more satisfied if they boiled the stuffed meatballs.,3,1
Good in general. Quality for Kƒ±zƒ±lay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old...,4,1
I go here for the lahmacun; I haven't tried their other dishes; but the lahmacun is very good.,5,1
I eat it by putting adana kebab in between the lahmacun. Legend is delicious; try it!,4,1
Service is good. Lahmacun was delicious.,5,1
Turkish meat doner was good; liked.,4,1
"Service, respect, taste literally 10/10.",5,1
Definitely a good tripe soup; but I've had much better ones. Very clean place; prices are a bit expensive.,4,1
In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup.,3,1
Portion is enough; taste is average; but unfortunately there is no hygiene. We sat in the garden but there was a heavy smell in the environment.,3,1
I found the trotter soup I was looking for; it was very nice; thank you. Employees are not friendly.,4,1
The trotter soup I drank here is among the top 3 soups I've had in my life. The food of the place is very delicious; the service is impeccable.,5,1
The taste is excellent; the portion size is good; the price is a bit expensive.,5,1
Amazing!,5,1
The business demands money from everything; no treats!,4,1
Ankara's oldest and most beautiful soup restourant. Soups with very good hygiene can be eaten and drunk with peace of mind. Service is fast. Prices are a little high.,4,1
Clean and decent place. I think it would be better if the soup was hot and fresh if there were bread facilities that came with it.,4,1
The environment is clean and nice. The taste of the food was not bad either.,3,1
I tried almost all of the dishes and they are very delicious; but the mushroom saute was a little oily; other than that; everything was delicious and good.. the staff were friendly and very kind.,5,1
The service is good; the employees are concerned and smiling. Food is fresh delicious. I didn't like the Lahmacun very much.,3,1
Portions are big. The flavors are nice. Service is fast. Prices are normal. I recommend.,5,1
A successful business. It's pretty good in food. Prices could be a little more reasonable.,4,1
The ingredients used in the dishes were of very high quality. Really clean; decent and beautiful place.,5,1
The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious... The service staff is very caring and attentive...,4,1
Don't be fooled by the menus seen in the pictures. It seems less and smaller. I did not like the business; I do not recommend.,1,0
Covered doner kebab pita is also really delicious in lahmacun with cubed cheddar... The attention and care of the employees is extraordinary.,5,1
A delicious and clean place.,5,1
Reviews are misleading; I definitely do not recommend. Too bad.,1,0
Meals were prepared neatly and cleanly. It was a pleasant dining experience in a decent place. Thank you very much.,5,1
The appetizer plates were very nice; we were very pleased that we went. We ordered 6 types of appetizers; lahmacun and stuffed meatballs. For dessert; we ordered burma kadayif and k√ºnefe.,5,1
The taste of the food was good; but the prices were high according to the portion. Waiters tend to take the plate as soon as they eat; so people cannot reach the satisfaction of eating.,3,1
I ate lahmacun; so it was good.,4,1
The service is fast; the employees know the region and the cuisine well. Their lahmacun is very small in portion; the size of a hazelnut lahmacun.,4,1
Thank you very much for bringing the flavors of Antakya here.,5,1
Nice atmosphere!,5,1
The prices are reasonable; the employees are concerned and polite; the flavors are good.,5,1
Appetizers were good. The size of the lahmacun was good; Even though I ordered spicy; it came painless.,4,1
Great dishes!!,4,1
I tried it today. It was a place that I really liked. The appetizers were very good; I got the minced meat kebab; it was very successful. Staff was very attentive and service was fast.,5,1
There were burnt livers on the liver skewers; and there were uncooked parts in the chops. Good overall taste. Tripe soup is delicious.,3,1
It is a historical place. It is one of the oldest and well-known businesses in Antalya. There are delicious soups; home cooked meals; pita kebabs and doner kebabs. Prices are a little expensive.,4,1
We went for the tripe soup. I do not recommend; I did not like it; I ate better.,3,1
The lack of tea in such a high quality and crowded place is a big shortcoming. Waiters didn't care about us.,1,0
We can say that trotter soup is good. Rotary medium. Inside the restaurant it was very quiet. The staff is fast.,4,1
The ambiance is large and airy. The waiters are attentive and the service is fast. The tomato paste goes well with the trotter. The price is very reasonable.,5,1
A nice cozy place. It is easily accessible from all parts of the city. It is very interesting that the restaurant does not have a menu.,4,1
Perfect taste; same taste same taste every time I go. It's just that it's very busy; so the employees can't care much and the tea service is closed during the busy time.,5,1
Good place. Meals were good. Service is also good. There is parking in front for cars.,4,1
Very bad business. We were removed from the table because it was time for iftar.,1,0
Thank you for amazing dishes.,5,1
The fish served to me was almost raw; I couldn't eat it. A place that does not care about customer satisfaction.,1,0
I only liked the soup in the place; the fish It was very tasteless and unsalted. We ate fish bread and the bread was full of lettuce.,1,0
A decent place. You can eat as a family. You can eat many kinds of fish as grilled; fried or stewed.,5,1
Prices are not expensive; Mersin is a place where you can eat fish comfortably in the city; I recommend the fish soup.,4,1
Ambiance is a little bit old; but it is okay.,4,1
The employees are uneducated and sullen. Fish bread is not good; but fish soup is good. You can go to the restaurant for fish soup.,3,1
Great place and fish; thanks to the amazing chefs,5,1
Nice fish place; beware of the cats though.,5,1
The toilets were very dirty; other than that the food was good.,2,0
I like fishes especially in this restourant. I ate sea bass and it was great.,5,1
Food was good; delicious. Including soup. But there was hair in the salad.,3,1
I tried mumbar and stuffed meatballs; their taste was legendary. the environment of the shop was wonderful; the attention of the staff to the customers was good.,5,1
Everything was amazing; thank you Yesemek! I ate yuvarlama and mumbar.,5,1
As someone who tasted Gaziantep cuisine for the first time; I can say that I was amazed. We ordered 2 different trays in order to taste all their local dishes. One had soups and the other had appetizers. The flavors are delicious. It is definitely my recommendation.,5,1
Expensive but it is does not matter; flavors was amazing!,5,1
I had a nice dining experience. I tasted the local flavors of Gaziantep; they were good.,4,1
"The place is nice; Mumbar was smelling bad and the stone came out, I didn't eat it. The mince in the icli kofte was bad; sour. It's also an expensive restaurant.",1,0
They have very good soups and appetizers; including Beyran. Everything was fantastic. Oh my god Gaziantep!,5,1
Customer care is very good. We ordered the tasting plates and each one was excellent flavors.,5,1
It's a great place in terms of taste. The service is fast and the waiters are friendly. It's a bit expensive in terms of price; but you should definitely come and taste these flavors.,5,1
The food was delicious but not as exaggerated in other reviews or did not appeal to my taste. The environment is quite nice. The place was noisy because it was crowded.,4,1
Menu was like that; Recommend.,5,1
The attitude of the waiters towards the customer was cold.,1,0
Service was nice; I've tried everything on the menu over time and it's all very good. Prices are very cheap; you should definitely come.,5,1
Soup and tenderloin were delicious. Staff involved. Prices are reasonable.,4,1
Excellent food and ambiance.,5,1
Soups and pitas are incredibly delicious and the portions are hearty. The staff is very caring and smiling. Prices are reasonable.,5,1
Waiters didn't pay attention to me.,3,1
Friendly waiters; nice service and delicious food. In addition; the price is also affordable.,4,1
I can not say foods are bad but quality of foods can improve. Service is slow.,3,1
Nice pizza!,5,1
Everything was delicious. Business personnel were also friendly.,5,1
I used to come to this restaurant a lot. The flavors used to be better. I think the chef has changed.,4,1
We ordered the village breakfast for 2 people. The ones that came were quite enough and delicious. Also; the ravioli was very good.,5,1
Bazlama and menemen were delicious. The place was not clean so I did not have a pleasant dining experience.,3,1
The most delicious and sincere place to eat in Fethiye. A small family restaurant. I especially liked the veggie pancakes. I strongly recommend.,5,1
Delicious foods. I think place has to more cleaner.,3,1
Menemen is delicious. Homemade jams are very good. Vegetables were not very fresh.,4,1
It does not bad. The best part was if the price wasn't affordable.,2,0
The place is very cozy; the food was fresh and good. They served pickles and tea; both were delicious.,5,1
Home cooking is not bad in terms of taste. We waited about an hour for the manti to eat. Also; the place is a little small.,4,1
Turkish sarma was really tasty; liked it.,5,1
Turkish pasty was really tasty.,4,1
I didn't like the food very much because it was too salty.,3,1
Credit card is not accepted. The flavors are good.,4,1
The sauces are very tasty. People are friendly and the place is very clean.,5,1
The food is good but I got really bored after waiting about 45 minutes.,3,1
We ordered the Atom box (70 TL). Only cash payment option is available. They're pretty intense. The flavors are good.,4,1
The irresistible taste of chicken; sauce and spice that has been increasing for years.,5,1
Chicken pan and salad were okay; but not as exaggerated as other reviews.,3,1
Definitely the chicken and the side salads are also very tasty. Prices are cheap compared to this kind of touristic place. The place was a little crowded.,4,1
Place was not clear.,3,1
Sandwich's souce was pretty tasty.,4,1
Super delicious chicken; best in town.,5,1
The pos device cannot be used; so they only accept cash payments. I think this creates a problem in terms of hygiene.,3,1
We ordered stuffed mumbar; artichokes; liked and tamarind sherbet. All of them were good in taste; quality of materials and presentation.,5,1
It is one of the must-visit places with its menu that changes every day and includes original local delicacies from all over Turkey. The poppy and pistachio kebabs are a must try.,4,1
We really liked our orders. There were dishes on the menu that I have never tried in my life; nice variety.,5,1
Waiters were not very good.,2,0
Famous place; fast service; caring staff; the taste of the sherbet we tried for the first time was legendary.,5,1
Our choice was Antep style lahmacun; since I ate it last time; I found it very dry inside; unfortunately the taste of garlic was barely felt. The cleanliness of the place was good.,3,1
The variety is plentiful. Pretty clean and decent. They make very good dishes from the southeast of our country.,5,1
Today we had the opportunity to try the stuffed meatballs and lahmacun. We could not taste the meat at all because the cumin in the stuffen meatballs was too much. Lahmacun is good.,3,1
The waiters are generally very sullen and unhappy. Service is very slow. Nothing extra comes to the table. Even the starter appetizer; which is available in many kebab shops; does not come. Lahmacun was very dry and tasteless.,2,0
Food was good overall. The toilets are so dirty; we are disgusted.,3,1
Everything was excellent. Thank you!,5,1
A perfect view; a friendly and sincere service and great tastes...what more could you ask for?,5,1
The view is great. This may be its only good feature. Apart from that; they have extremely rude employees.,1,0
The food is good. The calamari and seafood are delicious. Nice atmosphere opposite the sea. It would have been better if there was some music playing in the venue.,4,1
Yummy; delicious and wonderful.. The view is as beautiful as the food.,5,1
We had dinner in a very stylish place with a beautiful view by the sea. The flavors were perfect.,5,1
A decent place where you can dine under the trees; accompanied by the moonlight. Employees are friendly.,4,1
Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways. Including overcharging the market price; charging you for double the weight of the fish & serving you a half the fillet and all the bones to charge you for all that.,1,0
The summer part of the place is stylish and pleasant; the view is wonderful. The food and appetizers are delicious. Prices were a little expensive.,4,1
Generally good service thank you!,4,1
Appetizers are great; the view is great; the place is beautiful; the fish is very fresh and delicious.,5,1
The theme of the place is usually white. This can actually bother the human eye on sunny days; so I think the wrong color was chosen. Fish flavors were average.,3,1
Food came late; pasta was cold. The waiters couldn't take care of us from taking care of the takeaway.,2,0
The ingredients used in the salad were rotten; I didn't like it at all.,1,0
Great chicken; thanks!,5,1
The taste is fine; but when you wait for the waiter for 15 minutes to order and wait for the food for 15 minutes after placing the order; the taste is meaningless. Waiters were very indifferent.,1,0
Recommend.,5,1
It had nothing to do with the chicken world flavor I knew.,3,1
Very tasty; I definitely recommend. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the prices are expensive.,4,1
We ordered cafe de paris; it was delicious; and the price was 35tl.,4,1
It is very crowded and arrives incredibly late. If you are very hungry; it is better to eat somewhere else.,3,1
Salad was not very fresh.,4,1
It was a bit crowded; but it's okay; the flavors were good.,4,1
Overall everything was delicious; however; we didn't like the eggplant salad; it was too sour and didn't taste like eggplant at all.,4,1
Raki and fish was good thank you it was super.,5,1
We went on a Friday and all the tables were full at first. Service; waiters; the ambiance is very nice. The menu was a little expensive.,4,1
Excellent service.,5,1
I recommend the liver and Cyprus salad; the appetizers are delicious; the price is good according to the place and the service provided.,5,1
We had a pleasant time. The ambiance was nice.,3,1
The smell of the wet wipes was very nice. It's a clean place.,4,1
We ate nice fishes; thank you.,4,1
Elite; delicious; central; what more? The most preferred dishes we experienced are sole fish skewers; fried anchovies and shrimp-calamari. They also bring fresh lavash if you want. The sole fish was amazing. Food is also a little pricey.,5,1
Thanks for the nice service.,4,1
Nice salad; it was delicious.,5,1
We randomly decided to stop by and have an ice cream; but we tasted the worst ice cream we've ever had in our lives here. I don't know if it was one of the flavors they used; but the products seemed to be out of date.,1,0
Have you ever seen a rainbow in these colors?! The 5-year-old boy would draw the umbrella more beautifully; which was said to be made of sugar dough. The cake doesn't even stand up straight. A birthday cake would only be so sloppy.,1,0
The pastry is very nice . It is more affordable compared to other places. I highly recommend other products.,5,1
It is clean and hygiene rules have been followed. The products are daily and fresh.  It is very rich in diversity. Every product you are looking for is available. You can shop without thinking at all.,4,1
Don't order anything at home; they're sending a stale dessert.,2,0
I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.,1,0
My and my 3.5-year-old daughter's favorite place is in Samsun; we love the products of this place the most.,5,1
They have very high quality cakes; I strongly recommend. Their baklava alone is not that good. Cookies are expensive; but they're fine.,3,1
They have various and delicious products. Especially the age cakes are very successful. The materials they use in the products are of high quality; the prices are reasonable according to the quality.,5,1
You won't regret that the products taste very good; but I've never seen such a bad staff before; definitely don't sit down and drink tea and coffee; take the product and leave; that's the most logical thing.,2,0
it is a very nice place for high quality and special tastes; the employees and the owner are very interested and polite; we are going with love.,4,1
Chinese salad and spring rolls were okay. I didn't like the veggie noodles very much. The plum sauce of the peking duck was delicious but the presentation was poor.,4,1
A place with a nice ambiance and delicious sushi. It may be called expensive; but unfortunately; the taste is not affordable.,5,1
The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.,2,0
When you come to the front of the place; its magnificent exterior design really draws attention and I think it was done very well and I personally liked it very much. The atmosphere is truly magnificent. We tried Chinese food; especially ramen was delicious.,5,1
"The atmosphere is nice and the food is delicious. We tried noodles, spring rolls; hot and sour soup and an apple dessert.",5,1
Food was a bit salty due to soy sauce. Prices are in line with the market.,5,1
The plate in the photo was around 340 TL. Flavors may be a bit difficult for those who will try for the first time.,3,1
I tried peking duck with orange and soy sauce. It had a somewhat offensive odor. Good in terms of taste.,4,1
It has cheaper price compared to other chinese restaurants. But the flavors were not that good. What was particularly interesting to me was that the drinks were very expensive.,3,1
The outside and inside of the restaurant is very well decorated. The ambiance is really nice. We ate sushi; chicken with mushrooms and steamed ravioli. I really liked the sushi and chicken; but I found the ravioli a bit bland.,4,1
We ate 3 Bentos and 3 Mixed Noodles. We liked everything we ate; it was very tasty. The service was fast; but it was a bit expensive for your information.,5,1
One of the places in Samsun with the most beautiful view and menu. A place where you can enjoy your dessert and coffee to the full while enjoying the sea view in front.,4,1
First of all; the service is slow and very late; and there are no crowds. I ordered a bulk profiterole. The portion also had 4 balls the size of nuts; and the chocolate was also tasteless.,1,0
Atakum Mado... What a need for another word... The taste;  quality of the products are ala. It is very nice that the service staff is kind; solution-oriented. Especially the sensitivity of the company official; it is very nice to be relevant.,5,1
There is no need to tell Mado at length; it is a clean and beautiful place.  But there is no standard; kadayif burma with pistachios used to be so unique that I would like to eat it everyday. But now sometimes it was burnt; sometimes dry; sometimes uncooked.,3,1
Well; it was very nice; the service was very fast and the prices are reasonable; I recommend delicious food.,5,1
I wanted a four-cheese ravioli. It's just that the sauce is nice. Unfortunately; it failed. All of the portions have adapted to the economy; they have shrunk.,2,0
My guest and I went for dessert;  we waited 10 minutes to get a menu; we placed orders; and we waited another 20 minutes. Of course; one person couldn't make it to the dozens of tables upstairs to work.,1,0
It may be the most friendly service I have ever encountered in my life.  All the employees were very sweet; caring people. the drinks and food were very tasty and fresh. I will definitely come again.,5,1
Something strange came out of the ice cream; the teas are stale and boiled; and you have to say an order two or three times; I definitely don't recommend it; it's a pity for your money.,2,0
The address of quality. The service should be a little faster.,4,1
Unfortunately; the sorbet desserts are not satisfactory. The air conditioners are not working. It's a humid environment. I hope they fix it.,3,1
Love this restaurant; thai style and good taste. Clean and good service.. Recommended !,5,1
I loved the ambiance; welcome and service. We ate pineapple; spicy shrimp; chicken noodles; and chicken pie. A little pricey but nice place.,3,1
You can taste different flavors on the menus. It's a bit of an expensive place. The waiters are nice.,4,1
Amazing flavors!,5,1
Ambiance were pretty good.,5,1
I like thailand foods but not like here ones.,3,1
The food is very good; the employees are very good and smiling. Prices are very reasonable compared to Asian cuisines. I will come here often.,5,1
We‚Äôve had a great dinner at this restaurant. The food was delicious; well prepared and nicely seasoned. I did not know much about Thai cuisine; but I enjoyed the meal very much. Plus the atmosphere of the place is relaxing; staff nice and friendly and prices pretty moderate. Perfect spot to eat out with friends in the center of Istanbul. Would love to come back again!,4,1
Although far easts foods suits my taste; Tom Yum soup was very aromatic and different; I didn't like it.,5,1
The waiters took care of me. That's why I left the restaurant before I could order.,1,0
Egg dish was super salty. Beef with veggies was really good. A bit on the pricier side compared with local Turkish food; but when your Thai GF wants a taste of home; hard to argue over price.,4,1
The staff is very nice. The food is quite delicious.,5,1
"The environment is nice, the food is delicious, the employees are polite. We ate meatballs in ƒ∞neg√∂l. the manti were great.",5,1
It's an expensive restaurant.,1,0
I especially recommend wedding soup; stuffed meatballs; manti and Ineg√∂l meatballs.,4,1
Local dishes and soups are nice.,5,1
I did not recommend. Bad service.,3,1
The place is beautiful; the food sucks. Also expensive.,4,1
We came because the comments were good; we did not regret it. I recommend the beef tenderloin. Home baklava is also very tasty; prices are reasonable.,5,1
Delicious food; but their toilets are filthy. That's why I'm deducting points.,2,0
Famous and delicious meatballs.,4,1
The food is delicious; but we waited 1 hour after ordering and we were extremely hungry.,1,0
I ate H√ºnkar Begendi and cherry pudding. Both were legends. The meat of H√ºnkar Begendi was tender.,5,1
It has been wonderfully designed in its new location in Karak√∂y. It's gorgeous inside. Soundproofing I guess. The waiters are very interested and approaching with a smile. The appetizers and great service were very successful. Thanks.,5,1
A classy place in Karak√∂y with its white cloth and good service. Liver lovers should definitely try the liver pan.,5,1
The location is nice; the menus are varied; the appetizers are delicious; the prices are a little high.,4,1
Excellent appetizers; great atmosphere; acceptable prices.,5,1
The place was too noisy. We didn't really enjoy the food in this mess.,3,1
Some of the seafood starters are successful. Appetizers are small in portion size for one person. Salads do not meet expectations.,3,1
Awesome place!,5,1
"I can't say anything negative about the place, the ambiance; the staff; the richness of the food; the appetizers; the taste and the presentation; it's just perfect.. But I'm giving 3 points because it's a very expensive place.",3,1
We were not satisfied with the service at all. I ordered wine and it came with a little bit of wine in a regular glass.,1,0
Yummy yummy! Delicious!,5,1
The treats and the food were really delicious; each of them was not one of those places that would cause you to come to the place and leave unhappy.,5,1
We came up with the suggestion; everything was very nice.Especially Koksal; who was in the safe; was so interested. Thank you so much for everything.,5,1
Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.,3,1
The parking area is large; valet service is offered. The welcome at the entrance is good. Attention should be paid to order and cleanliness.,1,0
The employees are friendly. The prices are also very reasonable according to the food provided. I can call it the first choice in Samsun.,4,1
The place is quite big; the employees are interested and friendly; this is 2.development 5 skewers and buttermilk cost 105 tl I liked the price as appropriate.,4,1
Its breakfast is really very good. I would like to especially point out that you do not need to go to Cakalli for Menemen; you can eat the most delicious here. I really like the fried egg too.,5,1
They've reduced the menus so much that you can't get enough. The service was over.,2,0
There are a lot of appetizers; the service is fast and the employees are interested; there is a lot of liver servings; but I couldn't catch the taste I wanted; the prices are a little high.,3,1
The staff is extremely interested; the taste is already a very good place. It is recommended.,5,1
The food wasn't bad; we got tired of constantly asking for lavash bread; the liver; until the bread came to the table it became like ice.,2,0
It is a great place for Samsun. The taste; the treats; the semolina dessert with ice cream that comes after the meal; the variety of the menu; the attention and politeness of the waiters are very good.,5,1
We went to Iftar; especially they praised the appetizers and treats very much; but as can be seen from the photo; it's not good at all. It was an incredible crowd.,3,1
It's delicious; fast and has friendly staff. Although the price seems a little expensive; it meets this with unlimited tea; dessert service and appetizers.,4,1
The place is nice; the employees are good. The food is delicious but the human pilfering for extra charge caused me to give it 1 point.,1,0
Congratulations; everything was very nice and attentive. The treats were too much for the number of people. Cacik is given in aspava in Ankara; this can also be included in the treats; I can say this in addition.,4,1
The prices were in the 120-140 range. I didn't like Lahmacun. The appetizers were nice.,2,0
Every time I go; the prices change; I don't like it. But even for the treats; you can go; which comes as many appetizers; tea; etc. as you want.,4,1
We went for dinner. after 10 minutes; they said do you want meatball; we bought 1 piece; we asked for an account of 32TL; then they reflected it to the account; they put water in the glasses unannounced; they wrote 20TL to the 1.5 liter water on the table. They're not supposed to do it this way.,3,1
The sauces and uncooked meats of the dishes give the impression of a meal prepared in the mall and not in a kebab restaurant.,2,0
Very; very expensive extravagant prices. One lahmacun is 85 TL. They charge 25 TL for a glass of buttermilk. All the intertwined tables are almost adjacent.,1,0
I ate closed doner pita pita were very tasty. Iskender was beautiful. There is a playground for children. Great on treats.,5,1
Prices are reasonable; foods were delicious.,4,1
"The place was full of flies and one of them fell into my food. When I asked for my meal to be changed,; they refused.",1,0
The atmosphere was spacious and the waiters were nice. The meals were very delicious... the prices were reasonable; but the portions were small.,4,1
The food is super delicious; I especially recommend the fig dessert. Service personnel interest and hygiene were also high.,5,1
Dirty plates; Waiters was surly.,3,1
The meals were delicious. Service is fast; transportation is easy; staff is friendly. Prices are quite reasonable.,5,1
The waiters are scruffy so we didn't feel comfortable eating. The hygiene of the place was also bad.,1,0
Great ambiance!,5,1
Salad was great; appetizers were good. The degree of cooking of the meat was good. Also the toilets were very clean.,4,1
Portions were small but expensive.,3,1
The satisfying menu of local dishes; the taste of the food and the interest of the employees are very good. The advantage is that it is on the road and has its own parking lot.,5,1
Everything was excellent; especially sea foods!,5,1
Bosphorus Salad; Shrimp Cizlama were really successful. Orders came to my table quickly.,5,1
I am a regular at this place; and I love it as a family The food is fantastic; the fish are great!,5,1
Food was a little expensive but it is ok.,3,1
Clean place; the service is good; Prices are not very cheap. generally the Arabs are leaving; locals are also present. Service is fast.,4,1

A restaurant where you can eat amazing seafood in a great atmosphere in Bursa. Its taste will really surprise you. I would like to remind you that there is no Alcohol in the restaurant. Bon appetit now!,5,1
Expensive place.,1,0

The environment is decent; the service is fast and clean. The interior is spacious; the waiters are knowledgeable and respectful.,5,1
The assortment is exceptionally good. Fish and accompanying appetizers are very diverse and sufficient. Everything was fresh.,5,1
The place was nice; but be aware of an expensive place.,4,1
The flavors are still fabulous; Prices may change according to the conditions of the day. But the taste is always great.,4,1
Their desserts were really good and tasty but the prices were high.,4,1
We ate an excellent baklava. But the price wasn't perfect.,5,1
Gaziantep was one of the cities we visited during our trip to Southeast Anatolia. We decided to eat baklava from Kocak Baklava. It is the number ten place for me with its understanding of both quality and service. When I come to Gaziantep again; I want to stop by here again and eat this baklava again.,3,1
The waiters were extremely indifferent. We asked for peanuts to taste and they added it to the account. However; the head office was very good.,1,0
The staff; the dessert; the place; the ambiance; everything is very nice. It was the best baklava I have ever eaten in my life!,5,1
Nice ambiance; tasty and crispy baklava and sobiyet.,5,1
Great and tasty baklava!,5,1
They even charge for treats!,1,0
Even though we went late; the desserts were still fresh and delicious. The employees were also very warm and interested.,4,1
It's a women-only business. Staff and service are fine. Ambiance and design was good. Food options were few.,4,1
There are only female employees. The food is great; the price is quite reasonable and the place is very clean.,5,1
There is little variety of food on the menu. Also; the food on the menu is not very tasty.,2,0
I think the flavors of the place are overrated. Prices are also normal.,2,0
First of all; everything on the menu we tasted was quite delicious. The service was fast; the employees were very friendly.,5,1
Delicious!,5,1
A decent place where you can taste local dishes in Cappadocia. You can even go just to try the stuffed zucchini flowers.,5,1
It is a business that has exactly price performance products. You are eating home-cooked meals in a quiet; spacious and decent place with the service of friendly ladies.,4,1
Don't raise your expectations too much about the food; they tasted normal.,3,1
If you want to eat delicious home-cooked meals at an affordable price; definitely stop by during your visit to Cappadocia. The employees are kind and concerned. The environment is nice.,5,1
Service was great. Recommend and thank you!,4,1
We had good food in terms of taste; but the portions were small.,3,1
Treats are good; but I did not find the menu very extensive.,4,1
Very bad customer satisfaction. The prices are so insane.,1,0
A good kebab place. The meat is very good; tasty; the meat is well cooked. The treats are sufficient and tasty.,5,1
It was delicious. Interest and kindness are good. But it was expensive.,4,1
Expensive.,3,1
The attention of the waiters to us was very nice. In addition; it felt pleasant to eat the hot meats.,4,1
Staff greeted with a smile at the door. The atmosphere was very nice. Delicious appetizers arrived before the meal.,5,1
Everyone is smilingƒ∞ the food is delicious. Great place; I recommend it.,5,1
The treats weren't enough. Also; as you can see in the photo; my food came a little burnt.,2,0
Thank you for providing quality service in a luxury venue.,5,1
Great service and reasonable prices. Recommend!,5,1
We ordered a mixed breakfast for 3 people and they brought it for 2 people. Service quality is very low.,1,0
Interest in Turkish customers was very low. All waiters were taking care of arab customers.,1,0
Location view is great. We ate meatballs and kuymak; it was nice. We thought that the dessert and samovar that followed was a treat; but I guess it wasn't.,4,1
We came across a slightly expensive menu with a magical view overlooking the lake and the Black Sea.,4,1
The view is beautiful. The food was very bad.,1,0
A restaurant with a beautiful view. It was nice to have breakfast with this view. The only problem was that the place was a little dirty.,4,1
Service is fast and friendly. Breakfast for 3 people is 140 TL; so prices are reasonable.,5,1
Nice foods; nice interest!,5,1
Food tasted delicious but some of the lamb chops were undercooked. Meatballs were also undercooked. It's a bit of an expensive restaurant.,3,1
Its meatballs were good. What they served on the side was also good.,5,1
We encountered a unique presentation. The prices are a little higher than the standard; but when you see the presentation and the quality of the food; you realize it's worth it.,5,1
Unnecessarily expensive; the Arab is addressing the tourist. good taste.,3,1
Perfect; a relaxing space. Quality and delicious food.,5,1
Not bad. Service was ok.,3,1
The products are good but quite expensive. The place is more interested in tourists.,5,1
The venue is the track and they didn't care about me.,2,0
All the food that came to the table was very high quality and delicious. I recommend it to everyone.,5,1
Affordable prices. Recommend.,4,1
You can find different tastes. It is open until late at night and serves with nice service.,5,1
Amazing foods but expensive.,3,1
A must try place. It is possible to become addicted afterward.,4,1
Hamburger buns are fresh; The patties are soft and delicious. Their special sauces are delicious; It adds a nice flavor to the burger.,4,1
I tried the orient burger and cheesburger. Oriental burger was good; but nothing to exaggerate as described. King crab was okay; it felt like I was eating dough balls rather than crab. Mayonnaise was not good.,3,1
The hamburger patty is very small; but it is very tasty and different with its unique sauce and bread. It was not pleasant that there were no potatoes in the menu.,4,1
The hamburger patties and sauce were very good. I think their mayonnaise is fabricated mayonnaise; It would be tastier if they made it themselves.,5,1
Really delicious burgers. The ketchup sauce they make is excellent. The point I want to criticize is the low grammage of the hamburger.,4,1
Really delicious burger. I would recommend it to everyone. Thanks to the smiling staff.,5,1
The taste of hamburgers is not as good as exaggerated. It's also an expensive restaurant.,3,1
The popular boutique burger restaurant of the street. bread; sauce and meatballs are very nice. Thank you.,5,1
We tried the Rib Burger and the Cheese Burger. They put cheddar cheese in the burger instead of cheddar. This idea seemed a little different to me. The sauce inside the ribs is a little sweet. It's a different flavor.,5,1
Burgers and fries were delicious. Burger meat came well cooked; I suggest you eat it medium cooked. The sauces are quite different and nice; you should definitely try it.,4,1
Too expensive; I can cook better. Also; ambiance of the restaurant is old.,1,0
Prices are reasonable; chickens are delicious; but what is on the menu is not real. They do not serve the same food as the menu.,3,1
My order was missing sauce; missing desert; missing onion rings; fries were cold and stale; fried legs were stale. What a disgrace!,1,0
They got my order wrong and got into an argument with me. You are disgusting! Terrible service; mismanagement.,1,0
Food should have been better cooked I think overall not bad.,4,1
Everything is delicious; there is a lot and at a good price. Service was nice.,5,1
The taste is not bad in general; but you can eat better ones in other restaurants.,4,1
No management; food is cold and bad quality; no ice in coke. Not happy at all. I recommend either change the airport manager or close that branch. Definitely bad service.,1,0
Classical chicken; not awesome taste but it is ok.,4,1
The manners of the employees were bad; They didn't even care about me. Bread was stale.,3,1
I couldn't finish my meal .Bad smell and bad taste. It seems that the chicken is spoiled. I don't know what to say; but you should not eat in this place. I feel bad because I decided to eat from them.,2,0
Delicious and reasonably priced!,5,1
The waiters are polite and very interested. The place consists of two concepts; you can eat standing or sitting. The flavors were perfect.,2,0
Pasta was fresh. There is always a long queue in front of the place. I ate fettuccine Alfredo; The sauce and flavor were good.,5,1
It was served quickly even though it was crowded. It is not a great taste; but it can be preferred for a quick snack.,4,1
Great taste.,3,1
There are many queues. There is a lack of coordination in the place. Even though you ask for service; they take the bill as soon as the food arrives. Not everyone can eat sitting down; We ate standing.,1,0
A delicious masterpiece comes out when it is made in a Parmesan wheel; made with fresh pasta dough by hand; and with its beautiful sauces. The price is also quite reasonable.,4,1
Personally; it's very nice Pasta is made; I tried most of the sauces; they were all very good.,5,1
It's a very sweet place. Thanks to social media; I learned from there and came. Pasta wasn't bad. In terms of taste; I think it is no different from normal pasta with sauce. The employees are very kind. Order speed is very good. Also; prices are affordable.,4,1
There are two parts that you can eat standing or sitting; I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable if you eat sitting down. It is served pretty fast. Prices are reasonable compared to peers.,3,1
Incredibly delicious and fresh; fast service and use of environmentally friendly materials..,5,1
Pasta is made there; orders are taken and served. All of them are prepared in one place in 20-25 minutes. The taste is good; the service is good and hygienic; I think it is a taste and culture that should be visited and tasted.,5,1
We went for dessert; but there are also food and breakfast options. It's not a huge venue and it gets pretty busy. We ate moblan; ibiza; strawberry puff pastry desserts. Moblan comes in huge portions. Desserts are very tasty and fresh.,5,1
Kukis is a great business that is both a bakery and a patisserie. Their cakes and tea are outstanding.,4,1
Reasonable prices and amazing deserts.,5,1
The cake was amazing. I recommend it. For those who want to sit and eat there; a big queue is waiting for you.,5,1
Their products are delicious and the sizes are nice. It is very difficult to take orders from the waiters because it is crowded. In addition; the prices should have been more affordable.,3,1
Service is fast. Pistachio prince dessert is excellent!,5,1
The portion of toast was small; never satiated. Desserts were good.,4,1
Great tastes; the interest of the employees was very good; thank you to them.,5,1
If you want to eat cake or dessert; the real taste is here. The place is very stylish in design. Each of the employees is very caring and helpful; but they have difficulty dealing with everyone because it is crowded.,5,1
Desserts are good but waiters are very surly; We were not well received.,3,1
You should not drink coffee; it tasted very bad. I felt like I was drinking earth. Other than that things are nice.,3,1
Great venue great food appetizers. I can be a customer from now on.,5,1
The meals are very good. Especially plevlevisca; soka and dried meat are very successful.,5,1
I did not like the interior atmosphere; seems a little old to me.,2,0
The place is quite intimate and the ambiance is very pleasant. Simplicity prevails rather than exaggeration and ostentatiousness.,5,1
I recommend you try the dried meat. But their beers were a bit expensive.,5,1
Expensive place.,3,1
All meals were successful; I recommend.,4,1
Lipa is a real old style tavern. There is a warm friendly atmosphere. Dry meat was very good.,4,1
Great and chill place; ambiance was nice too.,3,1
The atmosphere of the place is very good; the bulgur pilaf with dried meat was very good; the quality of the dried meat is a little low.,5,1
The variety is less. Rice and dry meat are very good. The ravioli was not good.,4,1
Beautiful; cute; stylish and delicious food. It's a bit sad that it is used more like a restaurant than a book cafe; as it turns into a restaurant at a certain time of the evening; so they took us to a place in the back.,4,1
A nice place to drink coffee while reading a book. My meat dish arrived cold first. When I reported this to the waiter; they warmed it up and brought it; and then the meat was dry. I did not see the interest that I expected.,3,1
A very well designed cafe; The library looks very stylish. The menu is as you can see in the photo.,4,1
Nice and fresh ambiance.,5,1
Flat white is very tasty and affordable. The interior of the place is very nicely decorated; I was like amazed.,4,1
Interior and location are nice; but not as nice as other restaurant of the same company. We bought a strawberry brownie cake; my friend and I both had a bad stomach.,1,0
I tried coffee and a desert; all of them was not bad.,3,1
We went a few times for breakfast; we were quite satisfied. The place is really nicely decorated. Breakfast for two was understated and good. The service was smooth and the waiters were kind.,5,1
We preferred milkshake and smoothie. Chocolate sauce added to the blueberry milkshake. The smoothie is also unrelated to the smoothie; it was quite sour; so it was not fresh.,1,0
A cafe where books and coffee are combined very well.,5,1
Ambience is very nice but they don't let you work at the outside tables; that is a negative point.,4,1
The place is not very big; but there are enough tables outside as well; but we sat inside. The souffles from the name of the place were very nice.,5,1
This caf√© was highly recommended by an Istanbul-based blogger for its souffl√©s. The unique 2D interiors and decorations caught my eye as soon as I entered. I opted for the Chocolate with Orange souffl√©; while my husband chose the Chocolate with Blueberries. I must say; the taste was absolutely amazing.,4,1
This is one of my favorite cafes in Istanbul. As you can see on the menu; the souffl√©s are about 100 TL; the drinks could be more appropriate.,5,1
I can say that the lack of lactose-free milk is a big deficiency for me. Desserts were good.,3,1
Tasty; delicious souffl√©s!,5,1
There was a queue and the cafe was small. So you have to be willing to wait in line. But it was still a good experience for us. The souffl√© was very sugary and after eating a little bit of mister. The gifts given were also very sweet and took us back to our childhood.,4,1
It's a very small and elegant place; its decor attracted me as I passed by. This cafe specializes in souffles of various flavors and the service they have is excellent and the staff are welcoming and cheerful.,4,1
Overrated souffles. It wasn't as nice as I expected.,3,1
I ordered the banana & white chocolate souffle. It was a little small but very tasty. They serve it with ice cream. The staff is also very polite and smiling.,5,1
It was worth getting up and going from Beylikduzu. Atmosphere 10/10,5,1
This is one of the best sufles I‚Äôve ever eaten. Although it was package service; I like the presentation; taste and texture of the chocolate. Thank you Suflor Team! ,5,1
As a doner lover; it met my expectations in terms of price; taste and service. It is sure to increase the flavor in wood fire.,4,1
Service was bad. I think a few treats should be given.,3,1
High aroma. It is cooked completely on wood fire and without gas fueling. It turns very well.,5,1
Great doner; I liked it. Portions of it was enough too.,3,1
Seriously cheap and affordable price for those who want to eat delicious meat doner kebab.,5,1
Doner was overcooked so it was dry. We ordered ayran; it came late.,3,1
Price performance was satisfactory. Although it was wood fired it could have been better. Maybe doner can be asked to be a little more cooked.,4,1
The hygiene of the place was not very good.,1,0
Ambiance of the place is old and neglected. Doner was ok.,3,1
Its wood-fired doner kebab tastes different; it's one of the best doner meats in this area; and it's affordable; too. Congratulations to the business. I will visit once again.,5,1
The meat is DELICIOUS; the price is reasonable; but the service is poor.,3,1
Definitely do not go without a reservation; it was overcrowded. We ate very delicious pizzas; but waiting in line for 1 hour didn't make any sense.,2,0
I don't understand why people wait so long to eat an average pizza.,1,0
The dough and zucchini of the pizza were very well cooked. The place was a little noisy.,5,1
You can definitely eat the best pizza in Istanbul here. The location is very nice. A good place both in terms of variety and taste. But the prices are quite high; Be careful.,4,1
Best pizza in the area; very crowded in weekends.,5,1
The quality of the pizzas was worse than before. They made me wait for a while even though the tables were empty.,2,0
There are so many types of pizza; you are surprised which one you want to taste. I found it very successful in terms of taste. Atmosphere and service was good.,5,1
I tried the smoked ribeye pizza; the dough is thin and very tasty.,5,1
Crowded and expensive place.,3,1
No bad. It was very crowded; there was no lighting outside; so we could look at the menu with phone flashlights.,3,1
Excellent pizza and fine wine. Both food and beverage portions are large. I recommend.,4,1
