Branch
Naive Bayes classifier - This Branch Contains my naive bayes classifier model for sentiment analysis. This is to be used on real world data for a business but is trained on data found online using 1 as liked or positive review and 0 as dislike or negative. From here I can predict how many were expected "Likes" and how many were "Dislikes" with a 78% accuracy on training data and a 87% accuracy on testing data this model has shown improvements. While this is a light model it fits the scope of the business need and can fulfill the wishes of the project owners.
