Branch

Naive Bayes classifier - This Branch Contains my naive bayes classifier model for sentiment analysis. This is to be used on real world data for a business but is trained on data found online using 1 as liked or positive review and 0 as dislike or negative. From here I can predict how many were expected "Likes" and how many were "Dislikes" with a 78% accuracy on training data and a 87% accuracy on testing data this model has shown improvements. While this is a light model it fits the scope of the business need and can fulfill the wishes of the project owners. - Python

Store Forecasting Competition - Here I used a Random Forest model to predict store sales and rate the accuracy of the model. This project was for one of Kaggle's data science competitions with my model achieving an RMSLE of 0.69 and the number one leader board achieving .34, making mine not too far off. Here I completed lots of data manipulation and time series analysis mutations to the data to get it in a clean processable form to run the model on. Overall a fun and challenging project helping further my experience in the realm of R. - R

Store Forecasting Competition Rohlik: Here I utilized a Light Gradient Boosting model to predict store sales and recorded accuracy by using MSE. This project was for a Kaggle community competition, at its peak my model got 37th on the leaderboard out of hundreds of applicants scoring a .0440 or 4.4% error at its best. Due to the weak correlations throughout the columns i decided to use a Light Gradient Boosting model as it takes up less power than its brother Extreme Gradient Boosting a.k.a XGBoost it also handles weak learners well and offers less hyperparameters to not convolute the tuning of the model too much. The competition was a fun challenge and put my model tuning skills to the test! - Python
