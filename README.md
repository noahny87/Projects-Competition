### Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentiment Analysis
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis, developed for real-world business data. The model is trained on publicly available datasets, where `1` represents a positive review and `0` represents a negative review. With **78% accuracy** on training data and **87% accuracy** on testing data, the model demonstrates improvements in performance. Though lightweight, it meets the business's needs and fulfills project owner requirements.  
**Tech Stack**: Python

### Store Sales Forecasting - Ecuador Kaggle Competition
In this project, I used a Random Forest model to predict store sales for a Kaggle competition. The model achieved an RMSLE of **0.69**, compared to the leader's score of **0.34**. The project involved significant data manipulation and time series analysis to ensure clean and processable input for the model.  
**Tech Stack**: R

### Store Sales Forecasting - Rohlik Kaggle Competition
This competition involved predicting store sales using a LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting) model. Despite weak correlations in the dataset, my model achieved **37th place** on the leaderboard with a **4.4% error (MSE: 0.0440)** at its peak. I chose LightGBM for its efficiency and ability to handle weak learners while keeping the hyperparameter tuning manageable. This was a challenging and rewarding project that enhanced my model tuning skills.
